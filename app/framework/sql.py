        Call flask.ext.restless.helper.to_dict method on self.

        Returns a dictionary representing the fields of the specified `instance`
        of a SQLAlchemy model.

        The returned dictionary is suitable as an argument to
        :func:`flask.jsonify`; :class:`datetime.date` and :class:`uuid.UUID`
        objects are converted to string representations, so no special JSON
        encoder behavior is required.

        `deep` is a dictionary containing a mapping from a relation name (for a
        relation of `instance`) to either a list or a dictionary. This is a
        recursive structure which represents the `deep` argument when calling
        :func:`!_to_dict` on related instances. When an empty list isencountered,
        :func:`!_to_dict` returns a list of the string representations of the
        related instances.

        If either `include` or `exclude` is not ``None``, exactly one of them must
        be specified. If both are not ``None``, then this function will raise a
        :exc:`ValueError`. `exclude` must be a list of strings specifying the
        columns which will *not* be present in the returned dictionary
        representation of the object (in other words, it is a
        blacklist). Similarly, `include` specifies the only columns which will be
        present in the returned dictionary (in other words, it is a whitelist).

        .. note::

           If `include` is an iterable of length zero (like the empty tuple or the
           empty list), then the returned dictionary will be empty. If `include`
           is ``None``, then the returned dictionary will include all columns not
           excluded by `exclude`.

        `include_relations` is a dictionary mapping strings representing relation
        fields on the specified `instance` to a list of strings representing the
        names of fields on the related model which should be included in the
        returned dictionary; `exclude_relations` is similar.

        `include_methods` is a list mapping strings to method names which will
        be called and their return values added to the returned dictionary.
