            "description": "New algorithms based on state-of-the-art machine learning methods are enabling a broad range of transformative technologies. Computer vision applications are no exception. At the forefront of this field is the ability to separate video frames into background and foreground components in real time on mobile computing platforms and other limited computational resource devices. With the growing demand for accurate and real time video surveillance techniques and/or interactive gaming technologies, computationally efficient methods for removing background variations in a video stream (which are generally highly correlated between frames) in order to highlight foreground objects of potential interest are critical in enabling applications at the forefront of modern data analysis research.  Background/foreground separation is typically an integral step in detecting, identifying, tracking, and recognizing objects in video sequences. Most modern computer vision applications demand algorithms that can be implemented in real time, and that are robust enough to handle diverse, complicated, and cluttered backgrounds. Competitive methods often need to be flexible enough to accommodate changes in a scene due to, for instance, illumination changes that can occur throughout the day, or location changes where the application is being implemented. Given the importance of this task, a variety of iterative techniques and methods have already been developed in order to perform background/foreground separation. However, they often rely on optimization routines that are computationally expensive, thus compromising their ability to do real time computations with limited resources.  New methods being developed must circumvent this prohibitively expensive computation to produce an exceptionally robust, efficient, and potentially game changing technologically, providing a foreground/background separation solution that is two- to three-orders faster than current methods. At such speeds, the algorithm can be very easily implemented on mobile platforms such as smartphones, thus making for a portable field device that can execute such tasks on a mobile phone application type of computing structure. Additionally, a number of technological innovations that can further increase efficiency by determining a small number of pixel locations that are maximally informative about the foreground actions in video streams would make identification and processing of information (for surveillance or gaming applications) even more efficient.",

            "description": "There is an ever increasing need for wide bandwidth receivers that are compact in physical size and have high data throughput. An ideal system would have bandwidth large enough to replace multiple systems covering different frequency ranges and would reduce the size, weight and power (SWaP) requirements for operation on mobile platforms. Sensors built from high temperature superconducting (HTS) electronics may be able to fill both of these requirements for realization of this need. A Josephson junction is the active element of superconducting electronics formed by two superconducting electrodes separated by a thin normal metal or insulating barrier. When a phase difference exists across the barrier, a super current will flow in the absence of a voltage where the critical current is the maximum super current sustainable by the barrier. The critical current of a Josephson junction is a function of magnetic field IC(B)= IC |Sinc BA/f0| where A is the area of the junction and f0 is the flux quantum. This effect may be used to detect magnetic field by DC biasing the junction above the critical current and by measuring the resulting voltage. A sensor using a single junction was demonstrated with a voltage to magnetic field response of 50 V/T over a range of about 10 \u00b5T. 50 V/T is very modest in comparison to interferometers built from two junctions connected in parallel called SQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference devices). SQUIDs typically achieve 105 V/T [2] and therefore have traditionally been assumed to be the magnetic field detector of choice. However the dynamic range of the SQUID is limited to about 10 nT in comparison to 10 \u00b5T for single junctions. Furthermore, the SQUID transfer function is very non-linear so to utilize it as a detector it is typically connected to feedback electronics that limit the bandwidth to a few MHz [2]. Using arrays of very large numbers of nano Josephson junctions will increase the output voltage and therefore sensitivity. The best Josephson junctions for this are nano Josepshon junctions fabricated with ion beam damage [3] because unlike other HTS junction technologies they can be very closely spaced (~150 nm) [4,5], positioned anywhere on a substrate and have excellent temporal stability [6]. Consider a 1 cm chip consisting of a series array of nano Josephson junctions in a meander line. Modestly estimating 400 meanders (25 micron periodicity) with an inter-junction spacing of 0.5 microns yields a total of 8 x 106 Junctions. Assuming a typical single junction ICR product of 10 \u00b5V and 50 percent modulation of the critical current to zero this yields 40 V! If only 25 percent of this signal had a usable linear range it would still yield 10 V/10 \u00b5T or equivalently 106 V/T which is an order of magnitude better than a SQUID with the added benefits of a large dynamic range, high-linearity and wide-bandwidth.",

Basic incorporation of new sensors will facilitate integration of new sensing solutions on relevant hypersonic problems. Physical understanding and modeling of real world hypersonic regimes is required in order to provide invaluable insight into aerodynamics, boundary layer transition, thermal protection systems performance, ablative properties, material effects, scramjet engine operation, and hypersonic instrumentation requirements/optimal locations.  Improvements in testing could be realized if new sensing techniques (i.e., modular, transferable to free air test articles, wireless, high density pressure or temperature sensors. etc.) are implemented, potentially resolving issues and reducing uncertainty. The full value hypersonic modeling and simulation requires appropriate validation data for vehicle aerodynamic design, thermal protection systems, scramjet operation, and/or performance. Due to the limited flight testing that has been accomplished on legacy unmanned hypersonic vehicles (X-43, X-51, HTV-2 and HIFiRE) better test data and modeling data is desired. Data collection should be sufficient to the address systematic variations of key parameters needed for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model validation. In order to assist the acquisition cycle as a whole, high fidelity data sets must be utilized in conjunction with multi-physics computational science and engineering (CSE) tools as applied to these systems. Ultimately these data sets will improve physical understanding and build confidence in the predictive capabilities of CSE tools.\n \nWe seek to address this problem through the construction of physical models suitable for high speed test track and wind tunnel testing and capable of providing relevant validation data to assist in CFD model and CSE tool development. We seek to enable state of the art data collection improvements that will advance new testing capabilities and/or reduce risk to programs steps by providing better decision making data. During Phase I, the contractor shall develop one or more representative hypersonic vehicle or hypersonic research cone, wedge, etc., test article designs and assess merits and deficiencies of each with respect to expected performance, fabrication, and testing. Detailed designs and design specifications for each model must be made available in the public domain in electronic format during Phase I and detailed plans to address this requirement must be included in proposals. Phase I proposals must also document the team's ability to fabricate and safely test articles. During Phase II, the contractor shall fabricate one or more of the designed test articles. The new technology must minimize vehicle integration requirements (i.e., weight, size, power, asymmetry). Advanced model construction processes, such as 3D printing, additive manufacturing, or rapid prototyping should be employed, if feasible. Updated public domain designs with actual build specifications for each test article will be provided. Sufficient test data should be collected during Phase II to demonstrate the utility of test article design and fabrication and the ability of test articles to provide relevant validation data. Provisions for public domain access to test data must also be provided.

E/O and O/E conversion losses coupled with high insertion loss integrated optics have traditionally impaired short-haul RF link performance. Recent progress in optical signal generation, modulation, routing and distribution along with detector technologies are beginning to remove this impairment and create new integrated photonics insertion opportunities for military applications, including but not limited to; ultra wide band receiver for Electronic Warfare (EW), True Time Delay (TDD), photonic switched/controlled solid state antenna, coherent THz Source, Antenna Beam Forming (ABF) and Beam Steering (ABS). The realization and deployment of such applications will highly rely on the ability to overcome the challenge of monolithic integration of analog and mixed RF signal processing modules on a single die. Current state of the art design and development SDKs and fabrication foundries, efficiently address digital integrated photonic designs; however to date, very limited efforts have been aimed towards development of SDK design tools for analog integrated photonic applications. Hence, there is an urgent need for a detailed investigation among available fabrication foundries and material platforms for their suitability in the development of analog integrated photonics for military applications.\n\nIntegrated photonics has the potential to meet military needs for decades to come by enhancing the performance of broadband analog and digital signal processing modules like modulators, photodetectors, switches and wavelength division multiplexing and demultiplexing. With recent military/industrial breakthroughs in the integration of photonics in RF systems, the operational bandwidth of military RF systems has increased by orders of magnitude (tens of GHz instead of GHz). In addition, it enabled a significant decrease of the size and a reduction in the power dissipation of military RF systems (i.e., EW, RADAR systems) - far beyond the possibilities of the current electronic RF systems. RF signal pre-processing, filtering and channelization are additional technology areas where photonics can bring value to military RF systems. The performance of the optical link is critical for successful utilization of photonics for military RF systems.\n\nThis effort seeks to address the development of an integrated photonic link and further cost and performance improvements as necessary for widespread deployment in military applications. Achieving low noise figure at frequencies to 100 GHz and beyond is highly favorable, along with efficient broadband modulation, compact, high power, low noise laser is also an important area of further integrated photonic device development. Improved link dynamic range is equally important. Broadband photonic link linearizers are needed to push the Spur-Free Dynamic Rang (SFDR) over the 130 dB-Hz2/3 levels.",

Past experience, deductive reasoning, and metadata have been used to support conclusions about structural capability or performance of infrastructure elements that have been subjected to extreme life events or overloads.  In this view, there is an evident imbalance between the remotely operated-to-autonomous recovery capabilities following the infrastructure assessment and the infrastructure assessment itself, which is heavily dependent on human reasoning. Advanced technologies, e.g., sensors and other monitoring devices, provide signals from which metadata can be extracted and utilized in an automatic assessment of infrastructure integrity. Sensors like micro-electromechanical sensors and systems (MEMS) can be embedded or added after an event to critical elements of an infrastructure to allow monitoring the performance. External monitoring modalities like cameras and radar afford an additional category of information. The successful technology will combine judicious choices of sensing devices and automated reasoning in conjunction with retrieved metadata to decrease the dependence on human involvement in the infrastructure assessment process.\n\nIn the most-desirable eventual embodiment, the technology would attach to and interact with a robot that is one of a robot team directed by the technology, first to conduct the assessment by a process of iterative refinement; then to direct the performance of repairs by the robot team, including emplacement of additional sensors to replace or improve diagnostic capacity; then to conduct a brief second assessment to verify the competence of the repairs and the emplaced sensors. As an installed array, the additional sensors should integrate into a global network that supports different activities from infrastructure assessment to continuous monitoring of conditions at any of the identified critical network nodes or parameters. The sensor technology should have a small footprint, ideally with dimensions allowing monitoring and interaction to the level of a few particles, to match the spatial resolution of a discrete element model---a self-sufficient organic element that can interpret the environment and act consequently. The technology should aim to minimize human intervention and be a self-sufficient partner to other activities that have associated human elements.

            "description": "The existing fuel cell state of the art now provides an advantageous source of prime power for most vehicular applications, both laser and microwave, under development at the Air Force Research Laboratory [1]. These efforts should advance the state of the art compared to turbo-generator power generation units, via SWAP and fuel consumption. There are several types of fuel cells; however, the hydrogen fueled PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) type is probably the most suitable at this time. The DOE has several programs working the development of fuel cells for automotive and other applications. These programs include the logistics of hydrogen fuel production and storage as well as the cells themselves. Based on this work, the time is now for AFRL to get involved and start planning the integration of fuel cell technology to provide the prime power for present and future advanced weapons systems, such as typical GA MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and up to combat aircraft, such as the JSF F-35. Projected burst mode power requirements range from 100kW to1MW average power. The projected energy capability should be traceable to more than 25MJ per mission. The optimum use of fuel cells for pulsed power systems uses the fuel cell to deliver a relatively constant power direct current that is stored in a Li-ion or Li-polymer battery, in combination with power electronics, to provide the high peak pulsed power to the load. An interesting advanced commercial PEM fuel cell rated at 110kW available from Nuvera [1]. Hydrogen storage and logistics problems are also being addressed in terms of existing components and technologies [2,3]. Fuel cells are ideal for typical AFRL pulsed power weapons applications. PEM fuel cells have no start-up time compared to turbo-generator prime power sources. The fuel cell approach advances the state of the arr by the fact that there is essentially no mechanical inertial or electrical inductance that seriously degrades the conventional appraoch of turbo-generators.  In missions that require a long stand-by mode a turbo-generator has to be running, no load, at rated speed in order to provide fire power on demand. Typically, a turbine consumes about 70 percent of the full power fuel when running at rated speed and no-load. This obviously results in very high fuel consumption for missions requiring extended ready mode duration. PEM cells in addition to having a higher efficiency, do not consume fuel at no-load, provide fire power on demand from a cold stand-by, and converts the fuel directly into direct current. The SOFC (solid oxide fuel cell) [4] is also a possible candidate for prime power. The SOFC fuel requirement consists has a wide range of acceptable fuel, including JP-8, ethanol, propane, and most hydrocarbons. However, the SOFC operates at a temperature of approximately 800 degrees C and therefore does not have an instantaneous start up time. In some applications the flexible fuel type logistics may be advantageous.",

            "description": "As directed energy systems have advanced in capability, development teams have also worked to reduce the size of these systems in order to make them deployable on various-sized platforms.  For a variety of reasons, the pulsed power driver is often one of the largest components in a directed energy system, and so there have been a number of efforts in recent years devoted to shrinking their size.  A key component of the driver with which to contend is the insulating structure, or bushing, around its output terminal, which also serves as an interface between the driver environment and that of the load it is driving (e.g., the driver may be immersed in oil or a high-pressure insulating gas, while in most cases the load is under vacuum).  Such loads may include high power microwave (HPM) sources, particle accelerators, or other vacuum electronic devices.\n\nHigh voltage vacuum insulators in general have been a topic of research for many decades, as they are used in many scientific and engineering applications.  The design of such insulators is complicated by the fact that electrical breakdown can be induced across the insulator surface by more than one mechanism [1, 2], each of which must be mitigated to allow the voltage capabilities of the insulator to be increased.  Increasing insulator size to enable greater electrode separation reduces the field stresses on the insulator and most often mitigates the breakdown problem, however doing so runs counter to efforts aimed at reducing overall system size.  It therefore is necessary to engineer the geometry of the insulator, including positions of triple points, and to carefully choose the insulator material composition so as to both maintain compact size and suppress the growth of breakdown mechanisms that are present with high electric field stresses.\n\nTo remain on the forefront of compact pulsed power driver development, the Air Force Research Laboratory desires to push the state of the art of high voltage insulators such that greater field stresses can be placed across smaller coaxial insulators for longer pulse durations.  Recent publications describing the state of the art for insulator development report field stresses of ~300 kV/cm being sustained for 100 nanoseconds across small samples (0.5\u20131.0 cm) of high gradient layered insulators [3]; these field stresses are several times the threshold for surface breakdown across conventionally designed insulators (50 kV/cm [4]).  We have an interest in exploring the feasibility of further increasing sustained field stresses by at least 50 percent (to 450 kV/cm) above these reported values, across insulators having operationally relevant sizes (several cm), for this same time scale and/or of increasing the duration of the applied fields by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude (to microseconds or 10s of microseconds) while still avoiding breakdown.\n\nTo accommodate the coaxial electrode arrangement, the insulator may be either radially or axially oriented, or some variant in between.  The first provides the most compact arrangement but has the highest field stresses (located where the center electrode passes through the insulator); the second can can provide a more uniform field distribution across the insulator with possibly greater distances between the high voltage and ground than in the radial orientation but at the cost of an increased volume required for the insulator.  The last configuration seeks a compromise between the two.",

            "description": "Air Force High Power Microwave (HPM) system performance is limited by material degradation in the presence of high electromagnetic stress environments. The next generation of HPM sources will require the input and generation of tens of Giga-Watts of electromagnetic power within a space that is small enough to be placed on an airborne platform or other compact platform. Current HPM systems are incapable of producing or withstanding the high electrical current densities that such future systems would require. Additionally vacuum breakdown within the compact source itself limits the output power that the system can produce. Advancing to the next generation of HPM sources will require novel materials that are capable of conducting high current without collapsing under Joule heating and without suffering breakdown. Novel materials designed to maximize (for HPM source cathodes) or minimize (for breakdown mitigation) emission where necessary may mitigate these obstacles and provide a means to obtain higher HPM power for compact sources.\n\nInnovative design of cathode materials capable of withstanding high electrical current density emission are necessary to meet the demands that future HPM systems would require. Such a cathode would be capable of conducting over 200 \u00b5A per fiber with cathode current densities of 3000 A/cm2 for 600 ns pulse or 1000 A/cm2 DC as a final goal, without degradation or destruction due to Joule heating. Moreover the cathode material and the HPM system material must be capable of producing high currents as well as mitigate neutral outgassing and secondary electron emission while under high electromagnetic stress. The HPM material must have a higher threshold for breakdown where appropriate.\n\nNumerically derived candidate materials are sought to meet the demands of next-generation HPM sources, Ab Initio numerical modeling of candidate materials in a high electromagnetic stress environment is now possible due to advances in atomistic modeling and the availability of large multi-core parallel computing architecture. Time Dependent-Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) and standard Density Functional Theory (DFT) based algorithms represent the state of the art for numerical solutions of the quantum many body problem. These methods will allow for a detailed understanding of the emission process in HPM sources. The Fowler-Nordheim relation, derived in 1927, for planar geometry, non-interacting electrons, and no accounting for electronic structure, represents our best understanding of field emission however with TD-DFT and DFT we can now move beyond this. Where field emission is desired (cathode in an HPM source) we seek materials and/or material configurations that will lower the voltage threshold for field emission and increase field emission current magnitude. Where emission is unwanted (an anode for an HPM source) we seek materials with high thresholds for electron stimulated desorption (ESD), field emission, secondary electron emission (SEE). These emission processes yield a plasma in the HPM source resulting in pulse shortening and thus degradation of HPM source operation.\n\nTD-DFT has recently been used to examine the phenomena of field emission from Carbon Nanotubes (CNT) resulting in the identification of adsorbates that significantly enhance field emission current. Potential Energy Surfaces (PES) used to describe the interaction between a surface and a molecule may be derived using DFT. The PES may then be used to determine forces acting on a molecule and thus describe the desorption process. The goal here is the virtual prototyping of materials with desired properties for next-generation HPM sources.",

Cyber operators, who may be new to this domain because of the high demand this need has placed on the Air Force workforce, find themselves challenged on two fronts.  First, they must try to make sense of the vast amounts of data which are being presented to them, often in raw format.  Cyber operators are drowning in data that they cannot effectively understand, manage, and use to make sound decisions.  Second, they are constantly trying to learn new tools that are being offered to them, each independent from one another with unique features, rules, syntax, interfaces, interaction techniques, etc.  The Air Force Cyber Vision 2025 (Maybury, 2012) enumerates four \u201cFocused, Enabling S&T Areas,\u201d one of which is \u201cOptimize Human-Machine Systems,\u201d and the near-term goal is summarized as providing \u201cAdvanced Situational Awareness for Cyber Operators.\u201d  Similarly, Air Force Space Command's Cyber Superiority S&T Guidance states that \u201cfor effective knowledge operations, technologies are needed to vastly improve man-machine interfaces to speed the assimilation of data and the development of actionable information and courses of action for cyber operators.\u201d  Based on these stated needs, the goal of this topic is to find innovative ways to optimize the assimilation, transformation, and visual presentation of cyber data in ways that support the operators\u2019 cognitive capabilities so they can effectively do their job.\n\nThe cyber domain has the unique characteristic that the resources necessary for superiority in the domain are not aircraft and airfields as in the air domain, but highly trained and competent personnel (Bryant, 2013).  This statement boldly places the success or failure of cyber superiority on the human factor - in the hands of the cyber operator.  Therefore, it is imperative that the information displays with which these operators interact are designed for effective human use.\n\nSpecifically, this process must begin with a thorough understanding of the cyber analysts\u2019 job (goals, tasks, objectives, information needed, decision processes, etc.), so the design team can determine the cognitive processes that need to be supported when these operators are performing their tasks.  The design team will use this knowledge to transform data and design visualizations accordingly.  Some visualization techniques that may be considered are parallel coordinates, tree maps, recurrence plots, theme rivers, and/or any new or innovatively used existing graphical techniques.  Visualizations can be static or interactive to provide multiple levels of information - overview, zoom/filter, details on demand (Shneiderman, 1996).  Visualizations may also include innovative ways to apply visualization techniques from other domains to the cyber data problem (i.e., determining how to apply text visualization techniques such as tag clouds to network data).  Iterative prototyping and user feedback should be part of the design process to ensure the visualizations meet the user\u2019s needs.

The critical, limiting factor of this technology is the sensor. Current sensor technology for head-mounted systems cannot provide the same performance, particularly at the lowest light levels, as compared to the latest image intensification technology. A high performance sensor could be integrated into a head-mounted night-vision optical system to truly provide a digital capability.\n\nThe limitations of the present analog approach (i.e., image-intensifier-based night-vision goggles) are the: size and weight, cost of the image intensifier tube, lack of processing capability, limited image transmission capability for sharing the visual image, limited imagery/symbology insertion capability, limited ways to obtain a polychromatic display, and limited spectrum.\n\nSpecific requirements for this effort are: light sensitivity, noise resolution (sensor element size), format size, total number of sensor elements, size, weight, power consumption, and cost shall be equivalent to or better than the current generation of image intensifier tube.

            "description": "Fighter pilot head-mounted avionics systems currently employ helmet trackers based on magnetic or active optical sensing techniques to detect the instantaneous helmet orientation with the cockpit.  This detection enables symbology or synthetic imagery to be mapped from the aircraft coordinate system to the helmet coordinate system for presentation on the helmet mounted display (HMD) so that it is perceived by the pilot to register accurately to the real-world outside the aircraft.  The threshold (objective) latency for this entire detection and coordinate transform process is <16 ms (<5 ms), with <3.3 ms (< 1 ms) available to the tracker update step.  Magnetic trackers currently fielded in e.g. the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) require each cockpit to be mapped separately in a time-intensive procedure with special equipment, and then re-mapped frequently whenever any change is made to that particular cockpit.  Active optical trackers as used in the Eurofighter Typhon HMD system require a flashing infrared light-emitting diode array (IRLEDA) to be integrated into the outside layer of the helmet together with multiple cockpit-mounted sensors to detect their emissions for processing.  Integration of active optical tracker components (OATC) into the helmet ties the tracker technology development to other digital HMD components maturing on separate timelines, prevents easy implementation for other helmet shell designs from other manufacturers, and impedes affordable retrofit to all air fleets.  Both the IRLEDA and OATC approaches add head supported weight to the HMD system.  Multiple imaging and processing techniques have recently evolved that enable a cockpit passive optical helmet tracker (CPOHT) technology to be developed to determine helmet position and orientation with threshold accuracy of 0.1-deg (17 mrad) forward and 0.25-deg (44 mrad) elsewhere.  Potential advanced, passive optical cockpit helmet tracking system include, but are not limited to, (a) an array of unique Quick Response Code (QR code) stickers applied to any helmet and interrogated via a cockpit-mounted camera(s) and (b) video image processing based on pre-processed outputs from cameras mounted on the helmet and/or in the cockpit.  The CPOHT design must (a) consider tactical cockpit space-weight-ergonomics-power-performance-integration (SWEPPI) constraints, (b) accommodate HMD night vision goggles and laser protection eyewear, and (c) enable installation with minimal aircraft modification.  The CPOHT design must also have minimal impact on the helmet mass properties (total weight and net moment arm).  Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and government facilities are not required.

Cueing is a core requirement for the symbology.  Currently fielded night vision systems perform imaging (sensing, processing, display) in an analog device comprising a low work function phosphor, microchannel plate, fiber-optic bundle, and visible (green) phosphor. Examples include AN/AVS-9 and AN/AVS-10.  These current systems, based on third Generation III (Gen-III) near-infrared (NIR) vacuum tube technology, are not digital. Digital sensors are beginning to appear that may match the scene image resolution provided by a Gen-III analog NIR tube, which is about 5 Mpx in a 40-degree conical field-of-view (FOV). Furthermore, these digital sensors can be sensitive to multiple bands: visible (VIS 0.4-0.7 \u00b5m), near infrared (NIR, 0.7-0.9\u00b5m), and shortwave infrared (SWIR, 0.9-1.8 \u00b5m), or to all three. Digital image sensors, processors, and algorithms are now available that can handle up to 1600x1200 pixels at 60 Hz, with a near-term path to 2000x2000 pixels at 60 Hz. Digital sensor technology candidates for DPNVG include the Intevac Silicon Imagine Engine (ISIE) devices (e.g., the post-ManTech 1600x1200 ISIE 11 and developmental ISIE4000), the UTC Aerospace Systems SWIR and NIR-SWIR cameras (e.g., 1280x1024 GA1280JSX-12.5-60 ENC), and commercial CMOS cameras with NIR filter removed to provide color VIS plus NIR performance.  The in-helmet portion of the processing load can be based current and emerging computer graphics and processor chips.  Digital microdisplays have appeared in multiple technologies--reflective liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS), transmissive active matrix liquid crystal display (AMLCD), active matrix organic light emitting diode (AMOLED), and digital micromirro devices (DMD)--with pixel formats up to so-called ultra high definition television 1 (UHDTV1) standard 3840x2160 at 60 Hz (8 Mpx, aka 4K).  UDHTV2 microdisplays with pixel resolution of 7680x4320 (32 Mpx, aka 8K) are in development.  Higher frame rates of 96 to 192 Hz may be required from the digital device train (sensor-processor-display) to match, from a perceptual perspective, a sufficient part of the currently fielded temporal performance of Gen-III tubes, whos effective frame rate is about 1600 Hz.  Similarly, current sensor outputs are typically 14b but available displays handle just 8b, so that improved dynamic range display devices are desired to avoid loosing sensor-captured scene contrast information.  The maturity of the digital imaging components for sensing, processing, and display is now sufficient, however, to initiate innovation towards a purely digital near-eye visualization system to replace the analog vacuum tube technology now used in fielded paranomic night vision equipment. These digital devices enable capabilities not available to the currently fielded analog technologies, such as image processing, fusion, recording, communication to/from the helmet system. Space, weight, ergonomics, power, performance, and integration (SWEPPI) must all be addressed in the helmet mounted design. The DPNVG must be designed to meet all safety-of-flight criteria including maximum head borne weight, center-of-gravity, and ejection wind-blast. Tiling of multiple devices (sensors, processors, displays) and partitioning of processing between the helmet and cockpit-interface box should permit design and fabrication of a DPNVG with threshold (objective) performance of near 20x20 acuity with WFOV 60x30-deg (120x50-deg), frame rate 60 Hz (96 Hz), dynamic range 8b (14b) and night-only (day/night) operation.",

            "description": "Man-made nanomaterials (NMs) are being applied in many aerospace technologies, and the health risks associated with unintentional exposure remain a foremost concern of their pervasive use [1]. Further, particulate matter (PM) and chemicals are released during various aerospace processes, such as jet fuel combustion and practices where materials are burned or detonated. The toxicity of individual NMs, incidental PM and chemical species, in addition to particulate/chemical mixtures are critical to understand for both protecting military personnel and advancing aerospace technologies. Currently, standard in vitro models do not represent the complexity of in vivo conditions [2,3]. Due to the requirement to replace in vivo models to address high cost and ethical concerns, dynamic in vitro models incorporating shear flow and mechanical flexure simulating whole organs are critical. Progress has been made towards this end, such as the development of the lung-on-a-chip model [4]. Advantages of this model is that the chip is optically transparent, allowing for cellular imaging-based endpoints, and has a high elasticity, allowing for mechanical flexure to simulate breathing. There are also drawbacks to the current organ-on-a-chip models. They are limited by traditional fabrication approaches and polymer properties. The polymer commonly used to fabricate the chips, polydimethylsiloxane, suffers from chemical incompatibility. For example, it swells when exposed to chemicals of key concern in aerospace applications, such as hexane and toluene [5]. Therefore, further developments are required in order to improve the complexity of in vitro investigations to support aerospace toxicology. The membrane thickness using traditional organ-on-a-chip approaches does not closely mimic many in vivo membranes. One models of top interest for aerospace toxicology is the blood air barrier in the pulmonary region of the lung. The membrane thickness of the basement membrane in the blood gas barrier is on the order of 0.05 microns, and the thickness of the blood gas barrier in the human lung is 0.2 microns [6]. However, elastic membranes demonstrated in published organ-on-a-chip models are limited to about 10 microns [4]. In addition to thickness, the surface area of the membrane should also be sufficient to allow for enough cells to be grown while remaining within the limits for typical biochemical assays (= 0.2 cm2). The key phases of the project will include (1) design a novel fabrication approach and prototype for a micro-structure device incorporating shear flow and mechanical manipulation, (2) validate the prototype to reproduce whole organ responses to insult or toxic exposures, and (3) incorporate the device into an instrument for producing cyclic mechanical stimulation media perfusion and controlled cell culture conditions. Convenience and aesthetics should be considered at all phases for proper and proficient use. The impact of this technology is to reduce the use of animal models for toxicity testing, thus reducing cost and ethical concerns and increasing throughput.",

            "description": "Knowledge gaps exist in the molecular characterization of the operational environments faced by today\u2019s airmen.  As an example, in 2011, the entire F-22 fleet was grounded for nearly five months due to a series of incidents where pilots had experienced symptoms such as shortness of breath, disorientation, confusion, and headache with no clear cause identified. This led to a series of formal investigations that identified the need to improve our analytical toolset and understanding of the environments encountered in the F22A Raptor and other high performance aircraft, and their effects on the humans operating them.\n\nModern high performance aircraft, such as the F22A, utilize engine bleed air filtered through an onboard oxygen generating systems to provide the oxygen supply for air crew.  The OBOGS (On-Board Oxygen Generating System) uses a molecular sieve to concentrate oxygen in pressurized air from the turbine engine compressor on a schedule associated with aircraft altitude in order to compensate for the decrease in oxygen partial pressure and to protect the pilot against rapid decompression.  Investigations conducted by the Air Force of in-flight, physiological incidents did not identify contaminants as a root cause in any reported cases; however, a gap exists in the ability for real-time monitoring of the pilot air supply. Development of an orthogonal sensor suite for use in flight will enable continuous assessment of pilot air quality and will prove invaluable in the evaluation of OBOGS efficiency and pilot safety.  Finally, real-time detection of potential contaminants would allow investigators to determine if those compounds may contribute to future incidents and, if so, what the source is, thus enabling engineers to eliminate or mitigate the problem and ensure protection of the pilots and their full capability to operate the aircraft.\n\nMonitoring the OBOGS product air in-flight presents many technical challenges not faced by ground based air quality analysis [1-5]. As high-performance aircraft are extremely limited in terms of space and weight, any fielded sensor packages must be minimal in terms of their space footprint and weight. The device must function in a high oxygen, low humidity environment which may experience rapid altitude (pressure) changes as dictated by the mission [6].  Additionally, as the developed sensor platform would be used for both determination of atmospheric gas make-up as well as broad screening of potential volatile contaminants, a variety of sensor technologies (i.e., utilizing techniques such as ion mobility spectrometry) may be required for detection of volatile compounds at thresholds below physiological relevance [7-8]. Design considerations will also have to be made for a platform which performs non-obstructive sample collection in the pilot air stream, does not introduce potential leaks in the air supply, and contains all required electronics and algorithms necessary for signal processing, compound identification and quantitation, display, and data logging.  The ability to post-process data to identify contaminants not present in the pre-programmed library is desirable as well as is the collection of samples onto media suitable for removal and analysis in a laboratory setting (for purposes of verification and unknown compound identification).",

            "description": "The Department of Defense is preparing for substantial cuts over the next decade to military budgets. Despite commanders stating that personnel are the most valuable asset, when budgets decrease, training is often the first thing cut. It is imperative that, as we move to even more complex operational environments, we are leveraging developing technologies to ensure our airmen are developing and maintaining competency. \n\nCurrently, Air Force training is based on a one-size-fits-all approach that involves instructor-led classroom-based training and document reading-based certification. The degree to which a particular student develops competency from these approaches is rarely assessed. The state-of the-art in Air Force training research is the development of adaptive, personalized competency-based training technology which emphasizes the development of proficiency instead of simply tracking completion. \n\nTo accomplish this goal will require the development of an advanced learning management system that allows for position-specific personalization (at the job duty level), captures individual differences in training efficiency and retention by training type (e.g., classroom-based, computer-based, scenario-based), and provides personalized recommendations using advanced biostatistical analysis techniques adapted from personalized medicine. \n\nThe current-state-of-the-art learning managements systems are largely focused on identifying training requirements by position. One issue with this level of personalization is that two people can hold the same position title within an organization, but their day-to-day job may involve supporting very different mission sets with distinct software and tasking. This means that a person might have to accomplish substantial training in areas that are not relevant to their position. The first objective of this topic is to develop a Learning Management System (LMS) that is personalized by mission and position. The system would have the capability to identify the software on a desktop and use this as one input to determine the optimal training pathway that is relevant for the position. This would enable a much finer level of granularity and an initially more narrowly focused training plan, leading acceleration of the acquisition of initial competencies required for their job. As an individual develops expertise, the training plan would increase the breadth. Throughout an individual\u2019s career, the LMS would track the development of knowledge, skills, and experiences. \n\nCurrent learning management systems being developed will track an individual\u2019s knowledge, skills, and experiences across their career and recommend additional training based on gaps. One gap with existing systems is that they fail to account for individual differences in learning efficacy and retention with different types of training. Future training will be a combination of classroom, computer, and scenario-based training. Research indicates that there are often substantial individual differences in training outcomes (e.g., Allen, Hays & Huffardi, 1986; Gully et al., 2002). Currently, if a competency is not met after a training session is completed, the LMS will recommend the student take the same training again, with minor differences, if any, to the training mode. While additional repetition alone can sometimes compensate for learning challenges in a particular area, changing the mode of training can offer larger training gains. Current systems do not offer this level of tracking or flexibility to provide prescriptive training recommendations taking into account individual learner propensities. \n\nThe challenge of providing personalized recommendations to address individual differences has been addressed in other fields, such as personalized medicine. In the area of personalized medicine, the concept is that the collection of metadata regarding an individual\u2019s profile, along with treatment outcomes, can not only improve the ability to make future treatment choices for that individual but can also improve the ability of doctors to identify which treatment options will be the most effective for similar patients. Researchers are using advanced statistical techniques to interpret the vast amounts of health data from genetic profiles to side effects experienced in order to provide recommendations. This kind of personalized care has already made significant gains in patient health. \n\nThe LMS to be developed here should leverage similar methodologies to identify the optimal training pathways based on the vast amount of data contained in military learning management systems (e.g., deployments, position data, prior training data) and provide training recommendations. It would contain data such as recency, organization, position, where the knowledge, skill, or experience (KSE) was acquired, and the category of KSE. The LMS would allow researchers and instructors to analyze the data to look at training questions such as skill decay for different training types (e.g., by comparing at recency of training versus competency level at refresh). This would eventually allow trainers and researchers to identify optimal training modes that maximize retention and allow for the development of personalized refresher training requirements. This would provide the data the Air Force needs to push past the standard annual training requirement and provide training that maximally supports developing our force. \n\nFinally, the system should track data in a way to allow for a cross-organizational analysis of knowledge, skills, and experiences. The system would aggregate training data and provide a repository which contains knowledge, skills, and experiences for positions across the Air Force. The repository would be flexible (i.e., allowing more fields to be added) and searchable. The database would give instructors the ability to perform cross-organizational analyses of experiences that would allow for the understanding of ways to apply existing training environments to new domains to facilitate the development of expertise in our warfighters. It would also aid the prioritization of funding for the development of new training environments to maximize the cross-domain utility. \n\nThe Phase I work should be focused on Command and Control, Computers, Communication and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) domains. The C4ISR domain includes a diverse array of training opportunities and career fields. Optimizing training efficiency for these domains would have a significant impact in maximizing Air Force capabilities for C4ISR.",

The developed technology should be capable of fully characterizing the field at multiple locations (16 to 64), simultaneously.  If measurements are to be made with in-field probes, the measuring probes should be made of materials that minimize field perturbation and allow measurements with high spatial resolution.

            "description": "This effort aims to develop a phantom skull capable of measuring and recording electric currents delivered by a non-invasive brain stimulation technique known as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).  The phantom will then be used by the government customer to validate existing model predictions of electric current flow inside the human head.  This validation will allow modeling to be used to optimize tDCS electrode design, scalp placement, intensity and electrode montage to enhance cognitive performance or efficacy of therapeutic treatments for a variety of neurological ailments.\n \nTranscranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to improve cognitive functions in healthy people such as attention, memory and learning (e.g., Reis et al., 2009; Grosbras & Paus, 2003; Ohn et al., 2008; Fl\u00f6el et al., 2008), and several reports within the Department of Defense have speculated about the possibility of using noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) for troop enhancement (Russell, Bulkley, & Grafton 2005; Nelson, 2007). Additionally, NIBS techniques have applications to the treatment of a variety of neurologic conditions such as major depressive disorder, stroke rehabilitation, traumatic brain injury, etc.  The tDCS technique modulates the neurons\u2019 resting membrane potential by passing a small electrical current (=  2 mA) between two electrodes placed on the scalp.  This passage of current then creates a net increase or decrease in excitability in targeted areas (Paulus, 2004; Priori, 2003).  This altered excitability leads to an increase or decrease in local brain activity which can alter human performance/behavior.  To be effective, tDCS must target the task-specific brain areas or networks.  Because the current pass through a variety of tissues to reach the cortex such as skin, skull, cerebral spinal fluid, and fat the electrical resulting current flow can be non-intuitive and often is dependent on regional tissue conductivity and anatomical features/structure.  Effectively, it is insufficient to select scalp locations directly over the brain region of interest due to the fact the current may flow in an unexpected manner.  In an effort to optimize electrode placement for targeting of specific brain areas and optimizing human performance or therapeutic treatment effects, tDCS current flow models have been developed (e.g., Datta, et al., 2009; McKinley, et al., 2013).  Unfortunately, there is currently no methodology of device to empirically validate these models due to the fact it would require measurement within the human brain.  Additionally, holes or cracks in the skull change the passage of current into the brain due to the fact that the skull has low conductivity.  By validating these models with a phantom skull, they could be used to identify optimal scalp locations, intensity, design, and montage for electrode placement for a variety of human performance enhancement and therapeutic treatment applications.\n\nIt is anticipated the measured current range in the brain tissue is on the order of a few nano-amps up to 100 milli-amps, therefore, the phantom much be able to have suitable gain to measure in this range.  In addition, the phantom much be able to measure other electrical properties including resistance/impedance and voltage.  It is desired that the phantom have a measurement resolution of at least 1 cm2.  Finally, the measurement system within the phantom must also be capable of taking measurement from electrodes in-vitro (e.g. animal subject living tissue) environment and implanted electrodes placed in a human post-mortem skull.",

            "description": "The collective stages used to infiltrate a system can be applied to perform a broad range of attacks. However, the most successful assailants rely heavily on the reconnaissance stages, which are primarily divided as passive or active approaches [1]. Passive reconnaissance is a mere collection of information using search engines or various other methods in obtaining publicly available information. This form of information gathering requires entities to practice discretionary posting of information and is often a disregarded tactic used by sophisticated criminals today. The active reconnaissance approach generally results in the act of probing and scanning hosts or servers to determine IP addresses, database information, operating systems used, passwords, usernames, etc. While defensive tactics such as monitoring traffic flow with intrusion detection systems (IDS) or stateful firewalls can help detect active reconnaissance practices, attackers are still able to administer stealthier techniques, such as sending smaller amounts of packets to avoid detection. Since reconnaissance is generally the preceding stage in an attempt to compromise a system, attackers can successfully perform a multitude of attacks on target systems using the gathered information.   As such, increasing the effort required on the part of the adversary to obtain actionable intelligence, or providing inaccurate information altogether can enhance the overall security posture of a system or network [2].\n\nThere is a need for secure, infrastructure agnostic, solutions designed for cyber agility and anti-reconnaissance.  Such solutions must effectively prevent traffic analysis, and must implement evasive and deceptive techniques such as misreporting source and destination IP and/or MAC addresses, and intermittently changing those addresses.  The technology must be capable of preventing an adversary from accurately determining the direction or volume of information moving within the network, or the size or topology of the network itself, and must be capable of taking measures to prevent, detect, and cease communication with non-compliant or rogue clients within the environment.\n\nConsideration will be given to solutions that 1) have little to no impact to network performance or the availability of services, 2) those that do not require customized, or otherwise \"non-commodity\" hardware, 3) those that provide for flexible infrastructure or enclaves that can be set up, re-segmented, and/or taken down quickly, and 4) those that are capable of supporting a PKI or other robust cryptosystem.

Traditional reactive computer network defense techniques  have to constantly play \u201ccatch-up\u201d to an ever increasing array of cyber attacks being designed by our adversaries.  Currently, the extent and fixed nature of the attack surface presented by tactical IP networks provides our adversaries with the opportunity to carefully plan their attacks over time and to launch them at a time and place of their choice.\n\nThe Air Force is seeking new computer network defense technologies which can reverse this asymmetry that favors our adversaries.  Of specific interest are cyber hardening and cyber agility techniques for avoiding cyber attacks which provide a strategic cyber advantage by reducing or eliminating the need to fight, increasing the cost, time, and difficulty to launch an attack, and reducing the probability of a successful attack.\n\nCyber hardening techniques reduce the extent of the exposed attack surface by eliminating vulnerabilities in networking protocols  and services that may be exploited by adversaries to launch attacks. For instance, a network routing protocol that lacks authentication is vulnerable to spoofing attacks that can subvert the operation of the network. For this case, cyber hardening would involve incorporating the necessary protocol message authentication techniques.  Approaches for cyber hardening aerial IP networks that preserve existing investments in network infrastructure, e.g., tactical IP radios, are desirable to ones that require replacement of network equipment.\n\nCyber agility techniques avoid network attacks by performing evasive defensive maneuvers that present a \u201cmoving target\u201d to the adversary making it extremely difficult for the adversary to obtain a fix on the target for launching a successful attack.  Such real time network agility may be accomplished using a variety of synthetic redundancy and polymorphic techniques within the network architecture.  For instance, IP address and port hopping between communicating end points on a network may be used to obviate attempts by an adversary to track and target critical systems. Similarly, cyber agility techniques can be used to dynamically reconfigure the posture of a system upon the onset of an attack to enable the system to fight through the attack and provide continued uninterrupted operations. The key challenge here is to develop network agility techniques that are transparent to authorized users of the network and that introduce minimal steady state overhead.",

Some tablets already have support for TPMs, and the Trusted Computing Group has created a mobile version of the TPM specification [3, 4].

It is possible for the virtualization technology itself to take advantage of the TPM (e.g., Citrix XenClient), but there is little to no support for virtualized guest operating systems to leverage the same TPM technologies [1].

Compression methods should be developed in consideration of other factors such as transmission bandwidth [2], exploitation needs [3], and requirements. Compression can be achieved pre-processing or post-processing of sensor collection using various methods such as in hardware and software [4].  Various compression choices effect target classification, multiple-target tracking, and activity based intelligence.\n\nSensor phenomenologies (Synthetic Aperture Radar, Hyperspectral, LIght Detection and Ranging, Electro-optical/Infrared) impose specific, sometimes unique, considerations on sensor collection attributes and must be tailored to specific targets and mission parameters in order to optimize image quality such as the National Imagery Interpretability Rating Scale (NIIRS) needed for EEI satisfaction [5]. Settings to control compression in order to optimize bandwidth transmission and maximize data collection must be weighed against the data fidelity essential for exploitation and analysis. Additionally, considerations such as target location/orientation with respect to the geospatial positioning of the sensor and environmental conditions compound the mission planning and data/scene collection equations. Each of these considerations taken as a holistic set of variables has the potential of influencing the data fidelity required to answer specific operational imperatives. Operational needs can be achieved from single or multiple source sensor fusion techniques that are dependent on image quality.  Therefore the ability to precisely balance compression to accommodate mission expectations for bandwidth optimization with the data fidelity required for exploitation during the mission planning stage is critical and could be mitigated by a broker to optimize compression settings. A successful offeror can work with the technical point of contact (TPOC) to define relevant data, scenarios, and operational scenarios of interest to the DoD to evaluate target-based data compression settings tradeoffs.\n\nMulti-phase development should incorporate an adaptive trust metric with feedback to monitor and reinforce appropriateness of compression algorithm settings to satisfy the mission requirements for data throughput (bandwidth optimization) and data quality. Developments should include and assessment of metrics such as quality of service and information quality measures of performance and measures of effectiveness (e.g., reliability, trust level, exploitation accuracy, timelines) for selecting the most appropriate compression setting for operational success (EEI satisfaction). Metrics for EEI satisfaction based on the Data Fusion Information Group model should be developed for operational readiness.

Current defensive technologies commonly utilize a persistent defensive agent(s) on the each network system or workstation. The continued proliferation of attacks suggests that the current agent-based approaches to enterprise resiliency have limited effectiveness in protecting systems from compromises. The deployed agents add a significant overhead, drastically reduce performance [1], increase vulnerable attack surface, and act as a single point of failure that is the first target in any attack. If the agent is incapacitated, the system is in a state with limited defensive, monitoring, and remediation options available. In the end, current solutions are reducing operator efficiency while not providing resilient and adaptive host-based security.\n\nTo provide a resilient enterprise host and network defense capability, new techniques must be developed that move beyond the current approaches failing the network defenders. Existing techniques that have limited effectiveness for identifying and countering new attacks include system baseline, artifact signatures, and file type guards [2]. This topic seeks to take a proactive and adaptive approach to protecting, and defending the enterprise infrastructure by developing methods that support network resiliency, fight-through, and survivability [3]. The proposed techniques for protecting, defending, and remediating compromised hosts must demonstrate evidence to achieve enterprise scale (i.e., solutions should be able to scale beyond 10,000 hosts). Preferably, the solution should minimally invasive and ideally not include the requirement for significant new hardware on the network such as a centralized server. It is expected that proposed solutions will be agentless and not significantly rely on baselines or signatures. The live capture of information from systems will have minimal effect on system performance and will seek to first utilize common interfaces for integrating an endpoint. It is assumed that collected data will support the development of information assurance metrics that can be utilized for remediating and adapting defenses to recover to a state of reduced vulnerability.

In order to reduce this human intensive task, innovative machine-aided techniques are sought for searching FMV content for specific objects of interest. This is a high-interest technology for Air Force Special Operations Command and is crucial to enable the command to handle an increase in remotely piloted aircraft orbits.

Electromagnetic spectrum management is a term describing the blue force effort to apportion, allocate and schedule the electromagnetic spectrum. The output of the process is the Joint Restricted Frequency List (JRFL), which is designed to identify key blue frequencies and minimize electronic fratricide. The JRFL is a staff-oriented planning process not easily adaptable to dynamic combat operations and cumbersome to adjust. While spectrum management tools have improved significantly over time, the end result is still a relatively static legacy product providing little operational and tactical ability to plan and dynamically adjust operations in the electromagnetic spectrum to prepare for, react to, or preempt enemy use.\n\nNovel approaches are sought to allow the Air Component Commander and his/her staff to dynamically view and understand the status of blue air Electronic Attack (EA) assets and the red Enemy Order of Battle (EOB) through Link-16, intelligence feeds, propagation models, constraints, etc. to provide the first step towards understanding the EMS threat environment in an integrated tool. The tool when completed needs to highlight where blue, red, and gray efforts will potentially conflict and identify closest points of approach to avoid interference.\n\nThe commander considers options to deny red and/or gray use and adjust/time-phase blue use. It must also identify where simultaneous use by all sides conflict.  For example, service-oriented applications need to enable a commander\u2019s staff to plan tasks such as emission control (EMSEC) to provide quick look-through windows during the key seconds a net-enabled precision weapon needs an update. Once the plan is executed, commanders also need to assess if plan deviations adversely impact blue objectives, or provide unacceptable red advantages.\n\nThe successful offeror may work with the technical point of contact (TPOC) to identify scenarios and acquire data for concept development.

These objects range from satellites that are under positive control, to failed satellites, to space junk or debris. The U.S. Air Force and international agencies actively monitor these objects to provide early warning of potential threats or collisions so that owner/operators of the satellites can take measures to avoid a collision and loss of a satellite. Even very small objects can cause great damage, and a collision or breakup of a satellite results in even more space debris to monitor. As new telescopes and other space surveillance assets come on line, the number of objects that can be detected is rapidly increasing and will exceed the ability of space management resources (human and machine) to monitor and analyze satellite status and \u201cbehavior.\u201d\u009d As a result, there is a need for innovative and automated analysis capabilities that can capture or learn the normal status and behavior of satellites, detect changes, and assess the implications of those changes.\n\nDeveloping such capabilities requires addressing several challenges: \n\u2022 Developing and/or learning motion-based normalcy models which incorporate orbital mechanics and space-based phenomena; \n\u2022 Addressing the objects\u2019 life cycles in the normalcy models (i.e., from launch, through deployment, mission, and end of mission); \n\u2022 Managing position and identification uncertainty in the modeling framework; and\n\u2022 Using the normalcy models to predict behavior and detect anomalies in a timely manner and with a low false-alarm rate.\n\nMotion-based pattern learning and change detection efforts do not always incorporate life cycle behaviors, or deal with significant uncertainty in location or identification.

            "description": "Although clear air attenuation at either of the legacy SWIR and LWIR bands is very good, propagation through reduced visibility conditions caused by precipitation, haze, dust, and fog is significantly better at the longer wavelengths, mainly due to reduced scattering resulting from the larger wavelength to aerosol particle size ratio. Turbulence-induced scintillation losses are also greatly diminished at the longer wavelengths, thus reducing or eliminating the need for wave-front correction and other techniques required to overcome this additional problem. Recent increased demand for moderate to long range communications at extremely high data rates, and the growing lack of available RF bandwidth has resulted in the deployment of several new SWIR based systems, and has generated renewed interest in the LWIR spectrum to provide higher link availability in reduced atmospheric visibility conditions. Fortuitously, new component developments in the LWIR spectrum are now, for the first time, enabling practical implementations of communications systems operating at these wavelengths. The most dramatic and impressive of these has been in the area of Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL) sources. Compact, multi-watt QCL lasers, which can be directly modulated at GHz rates, are now available off-the-shelf.  These devices provide essentially the same Size, Weight, and Power (SWAP) advantages and functional capability as their SWIR laser diode and ER-fiber amplifier counterparts, but in the LWIR spectrum. Much technological progress has also been made on the receiver/detector side as well, but there is still a performance gap between the best LWIR and SWIR detector technologies in the general area of detector sensitivity, with the latter having an average advantage of 10 dB or more (maximum D* for  LWIR approx 1013,  maximum D* for SWIR >1014). Even with this receiver sensitivity limitation, operation in the LWIR spectrum offers a tremendous potential system advantage since even a slight degradation in atmospheric visibility can result in additional path losses of greater than 2 to 3 dB/Km in the SWIR spectrum. A number of new LWIR detector technologies have been explored and developed over the last few decades, including QWIP, Quantum Dots, and other variants of these. However, simpler bulk devices utilizing the older MCT technologies still provide the highest performance to date. (This is not to say that examination of the other technologies should be excluded, since the goal of this effort is to provide for the best possible near term solution in any form.) The most interesting new development of which we are aware appears to be the Electron Avalanche Photodiode (EAPD). These devices are reported to have the unique ability to provide orders of magnitude gain in the detector without the generation of additional detector noise. This would appear to create the same effect as receiving (or having transmitted) a corresponding larger signal, and thus providing for a correspondingly larger signal to noise ratio, or better receiver sensitivity. Therefore, the overall goal of this effort will be to identify and build upon one or more of the most promising existing or emerging LWIR detector technologies to provide a near term (1 to 3 years) LWIR detector solution which has optimum sensitivity (D*), bandwidth of at least 1 GHz, and operates at the highest possible temperature. Note that the latter criteria is the least important since cryogenic operation via micro-cooler hardware is a mature and highly reliable technology.",

Fiber optic data communication are used to achieve increased performance at reduced power consumption and electromagnetic susceptibility. The typical military aerospace environmental conditions create potential for fiber optic link degradation or failure. A poor quality or failing link has immediate & limiting impact to the platforms ability to accomplish the mission. Diagnostics & repair often take extensive amount of time and manpower. Typical fiber links lack systems for monitoring the fiber cable plant for degradation or faults due to connector contamination or damaged optical pathways.\n\nFiber optic systems with integrated methods of monitoring the cable plant and precisely locating faults have significant potential to reduce the total cost of ownership and improve the availability of the fiber networks over the asset life cycle. Avionic networks typically rely on a central switch to coordinate network traffic. This switch has optical connections to remote nodes on the aircraft.  Therefore, by incorporating cable plant monitoring technology into the central switch, the entire network will fault monitoring and diagnostics.\n\nAn important benefit from such a system that could exchange status and health information would be the ability to auto-negotiation the link data rate to optimize data throughput. The demands of improving sensor systems and the need to utilize legacy network require the smart and efficient use of the length-bandwidth limit that the fiber plant can support.  With the drive towards higher data rates, a system that enables 10 Gbs at a minimum is required.\n\nThe extreme environments of airborne platforms pushes the limits of current fiber optical networks and leads to many potential ways for a link to fail, from reduce link margin,  fiber breaks, laser source current draw and even dirt egress which reduces received signal strength.  A system that monitors the system health to a degree to be useful in understanding the failure or potential link failure mechanism is of great benefit to the warfighter.  Fiber optic transceivers with embedded optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR) and link-loss BIT present an opportunity for real time monitoring and fault isolation.  A monitoring system, when incorporated with prognostic and health management (PHM) approaches and software, can enable comprehensive condition and health indicators.  \n\nCompatibility with legacy airborne platforms is greatly desired.  These platforms typical are cabled with 50 micron OM2 MMF and 100 micron MMF.  In addition, new technologies which could enable better performance while maintaining a drop in replacement capability will be considered.  The system would naturally need to be able to survive extreme temperature and vibrations (MIL-STD-810, MIL-STD-883).  As such smaller packaging would be beneficial and would likely free up needed PC board real estate.\n\nTechnology development is required to achieve integration of fiber network prognostic capability into avionic systems. This research will investigate the strategy of measuring baseline heath and normal operation, network degradation, and deviations from normal. The developed algorithms must be compatible with autonomous operation, without impact to the existing aircraft processing capabilities.\n\nThis topic seeks an innovative switch architecture that incorporates cable plant monitoring, while minimizing the production cost and without sacrificing network performance and scaling.

To reduce the existing airfoil supply chain footprint, efforts should be taken to establish an innovative integrated low-cost, high-volume inspection and repair capability, with a goal of utilizing used parts which fall within the established serviceable and repairable limits.\n\nLarge quantities of low-cost airfoils, such as small, inserted titanium and nickel compressor blades, are being automatically condemned and scrapped after limited service, due to failure of inspectors to perform sanctioned inspections necessary to determine serviceability and repairability of these items. This lack of inspection or repair is due to the relatively low cost of the airfoil parts versus the cost of the inspection and repair the individual airfoils.\n\nThe proposed inspection system must be capable of processing up to 143 different part numbers, approximately 190,000 parts per year. Inspection systems must have a high probability of success in performing dimensional analysis and inspection of airfoils for the presence of cracks. Airfoils that do not meet documented dimensional requirements or flaw size limits cannot be reintroduced into an engine under any circumstance (e.g., Type II errors are unacceptable).\n\nThe current airfoil inspection processes uses fluorescent penetrant inspection (FPI), for crack determination. Calipers along with go-no go gages are used for dimensional inspection of cord width and tip wear. Any proposed methods should meet or exceed crack detection capability of FPI. Dimensional inspection requirements are on the order of 1 mil (.001 inch).\n\nTo successfully perform the work described in this topic area, offerors may ask to use unique equipment/data in the possession of the U.S. Government located at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, during the Phase II effort.

The Air Force is seeking to implement an automated part-handling and inspection station which has the capability to integrate these two inspections technologies into a unitized robotic inspection system.

The use of these weapon systems have, and continue to provide, unparalleled real-time information to the ground forces to support both the Global War on Terrorism and humanitarian relief missions.  However, as the use of these vehicles continues to expand into new and ever-changing mission sets that require more power from the integration of advanced sensors, the electric power subsystem is quickly becoming over-burdened and limited in supporting both current and future CONOPS.  The goal of this topic is to directly address this power and energy limitation to support future high-altitude, long-range UAS missions through the development of an all-electric (i.e., advanced battery or fuel cell power system) auxiliary power system to support nonflight critical on-board electrical power needs.  The high-efficiency APU may provide on-board electric power, either in support of a dedicated subsystem or a combination of subsystems as needed, for such functions as in-flight deicing, landing gear thermal management, and/or current and future sensor payloads.

The all-electric power system designed under this topic shall demonstrate a path to accomplishing operation in this environment as part of the design.

The Air Force needs to airdrop payloads within 150 m of the impact point from high- and low-altitude environments. Airdropped items that miss their mark create risk of exposure to ground recovery teams, while lost/damaged bundles can be costly to replace. Wind measurements are used to reduce error substantially. At some locations, however, bundles have tended to skew in one direction over another, due to terrain features shaping the wind vectors.  Variations in terrain can affect the flow of boundary layer winds and obscure the visibility of ground threats. Air and ground-based threats can affect the safety of the aircraft and even successful delivery of the bundles. To mitigate such threats, a pilot may be limited to flying a very constrained safe corridor to the drop zone (DZ).\n\nThe approach to the DZ may vary from mission to mission due to ground threats, weather, fuel, topography, or pilot discretion. Variances in the aircraft\u2019s approach to the DZ could be minimized via a navigation aid that directs the pilot (or autopilot) regarding which route to fly. Variances between flight crews could be minimized by self-correcting over multiple drop missions, making minor adjustments to the flight path to compensate for changes in the operational environment. These corrections could be computed automatically in real-time and regularly updated with data from prior airdrops. Machine learning could even be applied as part of the path planning solution at a particular DZ to identify trends in drop trajectories. Mission data could be recorded as it is being collected for use in future flight path calculations.\n\nThe desire is to develop a solution that will automatically input accumulated information from prior flight and airdrops, anticipate the bundle trajectory, and converge on a navigated path for a cargo aircraft to perform the air drop missions. The data assimilation process shall exploit historical data from the same drop site, terrain, obstacle, and current intelligence threat data in order to produce a flight path and an adjusted Calculated Air Release Point (CARP) that compensates for localized effects to improve overall accuracy. Sample historical data will be provided by AFRL for initial analysis in Phase I.  Historical data may include aircraft location and orientation at the time of release, planned and actual release/impact points, time of day, aircraft weight, bundle weights and trajectories, and weather forecast. Based on the variables described above, preliminary investigations should determine whether cargo drops really are subject to a statistically significant bias, and if feasible, determine whether these biases can be identified and compensated for in a consistent manner.\n\nProposals are expected to address data assimilation in a holistic manner, identifying whether and how data analysis can iteratively improve the calculated release point and the path flown to reach it. It is important that the flight corridor be part of the solution so that the adjusted CARP will be on that path, and so that the approach can be controlled. Computed flight paths should be converted into a visual navigation aid which shows the boundaries of the airspace corridor to be flown, probabilistic limits of the release point, and any necessary adjustments for the aircraft. Demonstration of the improvement in CARP calculations should be shown through the use of physics-based modeling.",

            "description": "For future gas turbines, it is desirable both to increase performance and to reduce operating costs. While turbine performance increases are achievable through increases in turbine inlet temperature, this often results in decreased turbine durability. Since designers currently rely primarily on an experience-based approach, there is a durability margin that is built into the design of turbine components (for example, blades and vanes). Consequently, component life estimates can be either over-predicted or under-predicted. If part life is greater than predicted, then turbine components are using more than the optimum amount of cooling, and the performance of the overall system is reduced concomitantly. However, if part life is less than predicted, then the system requires more frequent inspection coupled with possible repairs and/or part replacements. This inevitably results in increased life-cycle costs as well as reduced readiness of the armed forces. Further, turbine components are subjected to exceptionally harsh thermal environments, and the present durability design and analysis capabilities used at original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are not sufficient to allow for accurate predictions of component life early in the design cycle. Consequently, major Air Force engine programs may be subject to durability problems, including burning, thermomechanical fatigue, and creep of turbine components.\n\nFurther to the above, the next generation of military aircraft have a need for lower thrust-specific fuel consumption (TSFC) and higher power-to-weight ratio than current, state-of-the-art turbine systems, and this is consistent with the Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engine (VAATE) program Phase III goals. Increasing turbine durability and/or reducing the durability margin designed into gas turbine components can have a substantial impact in that regard. As such, the Air Force is interested in technologies that have the potential to improve the efficiency of cooled turbine components through development of advanced cooling patterns and internal cooling schemes as well as the rapid verification and validation of those advances during the design cycle. New technologies are desired that enable enhancements in HPT inlet temperature capability while also maintaining and/or enhancing durability and component life. Accordingly, a balanced approach is envisaged that couples the latest advances in physics-based turbine durability design and analysis (that is, conjugate heat transfer) with new concepts for airfoil cooling enhancement as well as an effective means to evaluate those concepts in a relevant environment rapidly and accurately.\n\nThe state-of-the-art for turbine durability design, analysis, and verification is provided via the references for this topic.  In particular, References 2 through 4 discuss the development, analysis, and testing of a turbine airfoil that is to serve as the baseline for further development in this effort.",

            "description": "New advanced tactical fighter aircraft use a network to pass information between vehicle management system, flight controls, power, landing gear, propulsion, navigation, air data, thermal management, and other utility systems. These systems are safety-critical and are responsible for maintaining control over the vehicle at all times. Because of the importance of military vehicle networks, the network interface standard must be able to send the data quickly, reliably, affordably, with low latency between sensors and effectors, and with immunity to electromagnetic interference (EMI). This is precisely why the world\u2019s most advanced fifth generation fighter aircraft utilizes the SAE AS5643 protocol over an IEEE-1394b compatible data bus for the vehicle management system. The current design includes the ability to self-heal when failures occur, but it can be improved to help maintenance personnel isolate subsystem, wiring, or connector faults. To develop and demonstrate these MIL-1394b improvements, a SOC pure firmware solution on an advanced flash-based field-programmable gate array (FPGA) will be used in place of the existing commercially available industry network hardware.\n\nThe purpose of this technology would be to allow the fighter aircraft to improve mission availability rates; this objective will be achieved by minimizing the risk of having a complete total loss of network communication by optimizing the bus re-initialization process after a signal remote node communication failure event, and reduce the amount of troubleshooting time by providing the information needed to detect and isolate the root cause of a vehicle communication network failure. This technology offers size, weight, power, and cost advantages by integrating the external communication interface firmware with the system process and controls algorithms. This technology will offer a more affordable network upgrade path for future tactical fighter vehicle management to incorporate advanced diagnostics, protocol improvements, and speed enhancements. A common embedded vehicle network diagnostics interface SOC will standardize the future of vehicle system networks in other aerospace and defense and commercial markets with a commercially-available, low cost, robust, and DO-254/178B software-compliant SOC for safety-critical vehicle management system control functions.\n\nThe current methods used for aerospace vehicle management system control leverages an open system architecture and commercially available IEEE-1394b hardware. This existing technology presents some challenges for the next generation more advanced military vehicles.  The new common embedded vehicle network SOC technology offers the ability to provide isolate-and-detect network failures when they occur and prevent the propagation of bus resets from occurring due to normal bus operation. The common embedded vehicle network diagnostics SOC must be compatible with the IEEE-1394b and SAE AS5643 message protocol, and fit on a FPGA in less than 56,000 logic gates, using less than 1.3 MB, consume less than 1 watt of power, support up to eight 3,200 Mb/s SERDES (with a desired goal of 400 Mb/s), and be able to startup within 80 ms. The operating temperature ranges from -60 degrees F to 160 degrees F and atmospheric pressures ranging from 0 feet to 50,000 ft in altitude. The common embedded vehicle network interface SOC interface diagnostics can be approximately 2.2 by 2.3 by 0.345 inches, intrinsically safe, and survive under varying climatic temperature, humidity, shock and vibration loading environments during takeoff, cruise, and landing in accordance with MIL-STD-810F.

            "description": "Non-fossil fuels, that is, alternative fuels, need to be compatible with the current fleet of military and commercial gas turbine combustion systems. Accommodating these new fuels with existing fuel system technology may cause performance differences in an engine. For example, recent work has illustrated that different candidate drop-in fuels can have slightly different physical properties as well as different chemical composition compared to the baseline JP-8 fuel. At some level, the differences, while seemingly small, may give rise to operability issues, under some conditions. For example, differences in lean blow-off, luminosity, and emissions have been noted. A particularly challenging application for these fuels is their use in combustion systems that may be prone to acoustic oscillations. In these devices, such as augmentors, the fuel is often injected as a liquid jet into a cross flow. As a result, fuel property differences can change jet penetration and droplet dispersion and can give rise to operability differences. Recent work has shown that JP-8 spec fuel derived from different feedstocks can exhibit differences in jet penetration and breakup characteristics. Other work has illustrated the sensitivity of spray behavior (for a fixed fuel) to changes in injector discharge coefficient.  \n\nTherefore, it is hypothesized that an interaction in fuel properties and injector internal geometry could be the key to 1) explaining observed differences among the behavior of the fuels and 2) identifying effective strategies to mitigate any differences due to fuel type.  If the fuel injection schemes differ for each fuel, then this dictates efforts to design and develop fuel injectors for each fuel, which is cost prohibitive. Thus, it is essential to have fuel-type-tolerant injectors, so that a huge amount of resources can be saved from retrofitting different classes of injectors to accommodate different liquid fuels for combustion systems.\n\nWhat is desired in this effort is an injector design, or injection strategy, that is inherently insensitive to liquid fuel properties. JP-8 fuel should be used as a baseline to which other alternative fuels can be compared. The alternative fuels used should meet the JP-8 spec but can be derived from alcohol-to-jet (ATJ), hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), and/or the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process. A mixture of alternative fuels and JP-8 is also acceptable. New ideas should be analyzed and/or tested by comparing the spray properties (SMD, droplet distribution,etc.) of JP-8 to the alternative fuels.  For an augmentor application, test conditions can range from 100 to 300 psi for the fuel spray entering into a cross flow of 0.5 to 3.0 atm. The temperature range of the cross flow is from 100 degrees F to 1700 degrees F, although testing at high temperatures is not necessary for a Phase I effort.  \n\nConsideration for retrofit applications as well as incorporation into future concepts should be given for any idea proposed.\n\nThis is a DoD-wide issue as non-fossil-derived fuels become more common.\n\nPartnership and/or teaming with engine OEMs are highly recommended.",

            "description": "Perforated liners act as acoustic narrow band filters, damping pressure fluctuations and in turn saving hardware from high-cycle fatigue.  Current technology uses perforated liners to damp high frequency instabilities.  However, in general acoustic liners have a limited damping capability below 1000 Hz and traditional Helmholtz-type resonators for low frequencies result in significant issues with weight (tens of pounds), size (characteristic lengths of a foot or more), and packaging.  Empirical correlations are typically used for designing acoustic liners that are based on parameters such as effective area of the perforated holes, flow length scales and engine cycle temperatures and pressures.  These designs are then tested in rigs and engines to show their damping effectiveness.  Oftentimes the design needs to be modified after the engine test since typical engine conditions are not easily attained in a rig test.  In the absence of a detailed design database and procedure, current design methodologies are questionable, especially for next generation systems, for which boundary conditions such as temperature, vitiation level, operating pressure, velocity/Mach number, and turbulence levels are expected to be more severe.  The local flow conditions in today\u2019s augmentors greatly deviate from the global parameters used to design them.  Because of this, improved concepts that capture the local physical phenomena and are able to withstand the increased thermal operating conditions are required. \n\nTypical methods used to eliminate screech and low frequency instabilities generally employ an trial and error method, which can be cost prohibitive, especially when applied to fielded systems.  Because of this, strategies for low-frequency acoustic absorption without excessive size and weight penalty are required.\n\nThis SBIR topic is not limited to only new devices.  An analytical strategy or acoustic model that models the acoustic behavior of the whole exhaust system, from the exit of the low-pressure turbine to the nozzle exit--that may inspire new damping ideas--is also sought.\n\nThe frequency range of interest is from 100 Hz to 1000 Hz.  Consideration should be given to eventual transition into a gas turbine engine where metal temperatures can exceded 1000 degrees F and the gas temperatures can be even hotter.  Material properties, size, weight and packaging will be very important in a successfully developed device.  The objective is an 80 percent reduction in peak-to-peak pressure oscillation for the frequency range of interest.\n\nA strong collaboration with the OEMs is highly recommended from the inception of this program.\n\nIn order to successfully perform the work described in this topic area, offerors may request to utilize unique facilities/equipment in the possession of the U.S. Government located at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, during the Phase II effort.

            "description": "Combustion instability is a challenging issue generally encountered in gas turbine combustors and augmentors. Combustion instability typically arises because of complex physical coupling between the unsteady heat release and the resonant acoustic modes inside the engine. This thermoacoustic instability can produce large pressure fluctuations that can lead to reduced engine performance and severe structural damage. In modern gas-turbine augmentors, instability or screech/rumble modes evolve both spatially and temporally and typically occur in frequency ranges from hundreds to thousands of hertz. Since local heat\u2013release rates vary in a combustion process, various modes and degrees of thermoacoustic instabilities will be exhibited. Moreover, because of the complex physical and chemical reactions involved in thermoacoustic instabilities, these instabilities are difficult to predict.  Typically, the measured flame-transfer function between heat release fluctuation and equivalence ratio (i.e., fuel-air ratio) fluctuation is required as a direct input for a combustion instability model. Noninvasive laser-based measurement technologies capable of measuring heat-release rate (HRR) and fuel-air ratio (F/A) at multiple spatial points and at a data acquisition rate of 10 kHz or greater is required to address the combustion instability issues in gas\u2013turbine augmentors. In addition to these primary performance parameters (i.e., HRR, F/A), the secondary performance parameters of interest are velocity, temperature and concentration distribution of key combustion species such as OH, CH, CO and CO2. These parameters can provide information on local flame-front phenomena and interactions between turbulent flows and chemical reactions for screech mitigation technology development.\n\nThere exist short- and long-term needs to develop practical sensing tools that will enable researchers and manufacturers to capture local variations of heat release, fuel-air ratio, and other parameters of interest (i.e., velocity, temperature, species concentrations) as a function of time. This knowledge will help track the dominant mechanisms that lead to and help sustain combustion instabilities, impacting designs of new technology. Fundamental laboratory research and development efforts are required to develop and demonstrate laser-based sensor systems for two-dimensional (2D), high-speed measurements of HRR and quantitative F/A in augmentor systems.\n\nIt is highly desirable that the developed sensor systems are designed with an emphasis on robustness for challenging combustion rig environments and are appropriately packaged for integration into probe housings capable of measurements in combustion hot zones on the order of 2500K and with an overall diameter approximately 12 mm or less. The current state-of-the-art diagnostic approaches that provide spatially and temporally resolved local flowfield measurements involve free-standing optics, packaged in considerably larger diameters, or involve approaches that are not feasible for probe integration into realistic test rigs or engine test stands at Arnold Engineering Development Complex, Tenn., or OEMs. Exploring fiber-based measurements of HRR and F/A with the aim of transitioning these sensor systems to realistic gas-turbine engine test facilities is highly encouraged. Emphasis should be placed on robust and compact packaging, integrating with existing cooled-probe bodies.\n\nIn order to successfully perform the work described in this topic area, offerors may request to utilize unique facilities/equipment in the possession of the U.S. Government located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB), Ohio, during the Phase II effort.

            "description": "It is a goal of the U.S. Air Force to maintain its various fleets of aircraft in a maximum state of readiness, while reducing sustainment cost.  The use of oil analysis as a means of continuous surveillance of the state of these fleets is a well-established practice, which has been employed by the Air Force and supported by its major equipment suppliers for decades.  In particular, the Air Force Oil Analysis Program (AFOAP) has been effective over the years in providing information to maintainers on the condition of bearings, gears, seals and other critical oil-wetted components.  In recent years, the use of oil debris analysis has been successful in improving the safety and maintenance of military aircraft and engines.\n\nDespite these successes, it is believed the oil analysis program could be streamlined and improved upon to enhance mission readiness and reduce overall system sustainment cost.  The Air Force currently uses a number of separate testing apparatus and approaches for off-line monitoring of engine component and oil health, including but not limited to atomic emission wear metal analysis, filter debris analysis, magnetic chip detectors, scanning electron microscopy (SEM)/energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), water/fuel contamination analysis, oil physical property measurements, etc. These health monitoring techniques often use specialized off-line instruments each requiring unique training, calibration, and operations, additionally driving sustainment costs.  Some tend to be bulky, costly, heavy, and environmentally sensitive.  As a result, they must be housed in dedicated facilities away from the flight line.  Samples are often collected and transported in batches to these facilities for analysis, resulting in potential delays in turn-around times and engine health assessment.  Converse to off-line apparatus, oil debris monitors (ODM) and vibration monitors are typical in-line/on-aircraft devices currently in use, but are size and weight constrained to fit within the engine area.  These techniques provide continuous health monitoring of mechanical components as the engine is running; however, these techniques do not monitor oil health conditions such as water/fuel/hydraulic fluid contamination, oil physical properties such as viscosity, part-per-million (ppm) detection of wear metals, etc.\n\nThis topic is focused on development of an innovative oil analysis, lubricant health capability that can generate equivalent or improved analysis, which can be used directly by flight line maintenance personnel to provide at-line actionable maintenance information or an in-line/on-aircraft monitor that can provide results on a pseudo-continuous basis while the engine is running, with the latter being preferable.  An improved oil analysis system should include:  improved portability (less than 50 lb) if at-line or ideally miniaturized if  on-aircraft, equivalent or greater analysis capability compared to the current methods listed in the JOAP Program Manual, pseudo-continuous on-aircraft or rapid (less than 3 minutes per sample) off-line analysis results, be capable of analyzing both MIL-PRF-7808L and MIL-PRF-23699G oil types, and have a good business case.  Having a clear understanding of current oil analysis practices will be critical in defining how the developed capability will meet and/or exceed these requirements. Working with a major engine company and/or oil company is highly encouraged to complete these steps and increase opportunity for technology transition in Phase III.",

Noise regulations proposed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) over the last two decades have continued to require source reduction of noise emitted from commercial aircraft. Noise from military tactical aircraft continues to grow as the need for engines with higher thrust and lower fuel consumption drives turbine engine technology development. High noise exposure from aircraft operations is effectively constrained by compatible land uses in residential communities around military bases. Aircraft engine noise also has a more acute impact of potential hearing loss on airport ground crews, and military aircraft carrier launch/recovery crews.\n\nResearch is ongoing in the area of supersonic jet noise assessment and reduction. Several methods have been developed since the 1980 to identify specific jet noise sources in supersonic jets.  As a result, noise from round supersonic turbo fan engines is becoming well understood.  Novel three-stream architectures are currently under development in the DoD.  In these systems, a second fan stream, or third steam, is used to optimize the engine over many cycle points.  Three-stream engines have the potential for up to 25 percent fuel savings.  The independent third stream nozzle creates shock and turbulence interactions that are very different from round supersonic jets.  Future nozzles may also be rectangular instead of round.  Finally, the aircraft will have an integral aft deck with which the supersonic jet and third stream will interact.  Noise sources from these types of nozzles with these features are not well understood or well modeled.\n\nCurrently available noise models predict noise from subsonic and round supersonic two stream nozzles well.  These models, however, do not accurately predict noise from supersonic three-stream jets, from other than round configurations with three-streams, and from configurations with integral aft decks.  These models also do not simultaneously predict engine cycle performance.  As three-steam engine systems are new, the trade space between the various exhaust system parameters, jet noise, and system performance is also not well understood.\n\nDesired is a tool for assessing the jet noise spectrum from current, two-stream, and future two- and three-stream gas turbine engines for supersonic aircraft. The tool must interface with gas turbine engine cycle assessment tools such as Numerical Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS).  The Air Force Research Laboratory has a government-owned two-/three-stream cycle tool called the GATE model with an NPSS interface.  The GATE model will be made available as necessary. The noise assessment tool should be capable of analyzing systems engineering alternatives and evaluate trades between nozzle geometry, jet noise and engine performance. The tool should be reduced order in nature but capture the physics of two- and three-stream noise sources.  The tool should be well validated with experimental or computational data.  The tool must be able to make a noise and engine performance assessment of an engine configuration under two hours. The tool should be able to run on a standard personal computer/Apple Mac.

These small spacecraft are demonstrating tremendous potential for low-cost access to space. However, militarily useful missions require spacecraft maneuverability. Presently, only cold gas propulsion with low velocity change (delta V) capability (< 10 m/s) has been demonstrated onboard cubesat spacecraft.  Developing cubesats with substantial propulsive capability will enable useful, low-cost DoD access to space. Due to cost constraints, traditional cubesat component developers (small businesses and university research programs) are not able to independently develop propulsion modules to acceptable levels of maturity.\n\nDue to the low amounts of electrical power available to cubesats, monopropellant chemical propulsion may provide a simplest method by which substantial propulsive capability (100-200 m/s) can be integrated onto a spacecraft. Very small chemical systems may have lower specific impulses than a number of electric propulsion concepts, but monopropellant thrusters are not limited by low electrical power levels and can produce much higher thrust levels for rapid maneuvers.

            "description": "Pervasive electric propulsion (EP) technologies greatly enhance in-space maneuverability and spacecraft payload capacity for many DoD missions, such as transfer to Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO), when compared to liquid chemical propulsion [Ref 1].  However, state-of-the-art electric EP systems do not provide sufficient thrust to perform some time critical maneuvers with available on-board power.  For superior payload capability and increased risk mitigation redundancy for DoD space assets, a high efficiency EP technology compatible with chemical propellants could be paired with a chemical thruster to produce an agile and efficient multi-mode propulsion (MMP) system.  An agile MMP system with shared propellant and tanks reduces system complexity and increases risk mitigation redundancy by enabling flexible and optimal utilization of propellant between the EP and chemical thruster system for in-space maneuvers, including orbit transfer, repositioning, station-keeping, attitude control, and disposal.  In addition, the agile and flexible nature of MMP enables dynamic orbit transfers, rapid response, and sustainable repositioning.\n\nRealizing these advantages requires innovative solar electric propulsion technologies with high efficiency and high thrust when operated with lightweight, molecular propellants used in chemical propulsion, such as hydrazine or advanced \u201cgreen\u201d energetic monopropellant formulations.  Examples of electric thruster concepts that have demonstrated operation with chemical propellants include hydrazine arcjets, magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thrusters, pulsed inductive thruster (PIT) concepts, and field-reversed configuration (FRC) propulsion [Ref 2-6].  To date, these EP technologies have not met the performance and lifetime requirements needed for agile in-space capabilities.\n\nThis solicitation seeks research on electric thruster technologies capable of achieving specific impulse from 1500-2500 seconds with total thruster efficiency greater than 60 percent using a chemical propulsion propellant.  Proposal solutions may be either ideas for improving existing thruster technology or the development of new concepts.  Specific power of the thruster and power processing electronics should be less than 3 kg/kW.  A representative power level for this technology is 3-10 kW per thruster, though demonstrations may be conducted at different power levels or with simulated propellant to accommodate cost-effective research activities.  The full propulsion system (thruster, power processing unit & propellant feed) should define a clear path for transition to national security space applications in the proposal.\n\nThe thruster technology should be capable of supporting a 15-year mission in GEO or Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) and five years in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) after ground storage of five years.",

Game-changing reusable high-speed air platforms critical to the global reach and superiority of tomorrow\u2019s Air Force will experience long-duration, time-varying, non-periodic, combined and intense, thermo-mechanical-acoustic loads over significant portions of their structure.  Designing and fielding these platforms requires the capability to experimentally verify and validate structural response, life prediction and durability assessment models and methods under these complex and challenging loading environments.\n\nLack of the necessary knowledge has resulted in significant repair and replacement costs for exhaust nozzles and exhaust-washed structures of existing Air Force platforms operating under combined, thermo-acoustic-mechanical loads, even when these loads are far more benign than those associated with hypersonic flight.  A full-field, real-time, strain measurement system would fill a critical gap in the capabilities needed for efficient and effective life testing of these complex structural components and would enable verification and validation of computational methods and models used for structural analysis, design and reliability assessment.\n\nWhile some noncontact methods, such as full-field digital image correlation (DIC) can go beyond point-wise strain measurements by providing the strain field over a reasonable-sized region of the structure under test, these methods are typically only able to provide detailed strain data after the test is over, due to the large volume of data that must be processed from the images that are used to extract the strain fields. The suitability of these non-contact methods to deliver real-time, full-field, strain measurement, which can be used for feedback control during the test, is severely limited. Moreover, the efficacy of these methods decays at high temperatures due to the de-correlation effects related to radiant light emanating from the sample at the upper end of the temperature regime, which is where the information is often most-desired.\n\nThe goal of this effort would be to develop a non-contacting, full-field, strain measurement system that can provide real-time or quasi-real-time strain data for structures at temperatures in excess of 1,800 degrees F, simultaneously subjected to high levels of broadband acoustic loading (165 dB, 0 to 1000Hz).\n\nTo successfully perform the work described in this topic area, offerors may request to use unique facilities/equipment in the possession of the U.S. Government located onsite at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, during the Phase II effort.

Requirements for more electric on-board power to enable the utilization of advanced electronics payloads and advantages in quiet propulsion has driven extensive DoD investment in power-dense permanent magnet motor and generator applied research and development for unmanned systems.\n\nThe focus of this topic is to fill a commercial void in the area of suitably flexible brushless and synchronous permanent-magnet motor/generator controllers appropriate for electric unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flight applications. In-house development of custom motor control electronics is outside of the expertise of typical UAV developers.  As a result, small businesses have struggled implementing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions due to incompatibility with desired control requirements, existing industrial automation drives, and high-performance aircraft electric motors. \n\nUAV power and propulsion engineers require a modular electric motor control solution with interfacing and control features not available on commercial RC hobby controllers as well as packaging more suitable for flight applications than industrial automation controllers. Often, advanced propulsion applications require user-developed inner loop control logic, which also is not a commercially available option.\n\nA programmable processor module and plug-and-play integration with selectable power stage modules would allow UAV developers to eliminate expensive motor control development without having to compromise aircraft operability using an unsuitable commercially available motor controller.  This will enable user-configured control logic specific to the aircraft\u2019s propulsion technology, advanced control through adequate sensor and processor interfacing, and electronics package weight, volume, and cooling optimization.\n\nThe Air Force is looking for:\n- Innovative modularity \u2013 power scalability and interface options allowing users to optimize electronics weight and volume while meeting mission requirements.\n- Default tunable motor control logic - software configuration tools that allow users without expertise with motor control to implement velocity and torque control.\n- Unrestricted access to modify current and voltage loop logic - software development tools that permit controls experts without embedded hardware expertise to implement custom processor intensive control loop algorithms.  This shall include configuration and access to available input/output (I/O) and gate drive parameters.\n\nOfferors are required to propose suitably flexible control and power modules that provide the following commercial and military applicable specifications:\n- Control for Permanent Magnet Brushless DC and Synchronous Machines\n- Modularity scalable over a range of 0.5-30[kW].\n- Minimal footprint thermal interface to user selectable/provided air or water cooling.\n- User selectable position feedback to include resolvers, encoders, and sensorless.\n- Six isolated PWM outputs for power module gate drives.\n- One isolated PWM output for a breaking resistor (recommended).\n- Switching frequencies in excess of 20kHz; capable of 1kHz+ electrical frequency.\n- Processor module shall be capable of commanding future power modules that have switching frequencies in excess of 120kHz.\n- Suitable electronics for motor inductance as low as 2uH.\n- Processor module provides SPI, I2C, and JTAG as a minimum set of hardware interfacing is recommended.\n- A third module is recommended for allowing for minimized complexity and weight of the processor module which is to provide communication interfaces such as the encoder/resolver interface and additionally CAN, RS485, and optionally USB protocols.\n- ADC interfaces (0 to 5 V) and Discrete I/O with overvoltage and transient protection.\n- Common programming interface such as C.\n- Optimized size and weight.

            "description": "Reduced aircraft engine maintenance costs and improved designs for future aerospace systems require accurate knowledge and understanding of complex rotating component boundary conditions. Advanced numerical simulations now provide high-fidelity predictions that must be validated in real-world component testing or operation with an escalating number of rotating sensors. Current analog slip-ring solutions for high channel count (greater than 300 wires) are limited by excessive wiring and noise pickup across long analog signal lengths and connectors. Available compact shaft embedded digitization and transmission devices (less than 3.5-inch inner diameter by 3-inch length) currently provide either high bandwidth capability (greater than 100 kHz) with relatively low-channel count (less than 80), or high channel count (greater than 80) at relatively low bandwidth (less than 1 kHz). Advanced system testing requires the need for both high-channel count, high bandwidth data collection in a compact package that can reduce wiring and noise.\n\nThis program aims to develop scalable high bandwidth (up to 150 kHz) rotating electronics to condition and digitize (greater than 300 kSamples/s) low level analog signals on rotating hardware and output a high quality digital data stream that eliminates or reduces current wire count per channel by a factor of 50 or more. This topic advances technology beyond state of the art by targeting these requirements for 80 or more simultaneously sampled channels in a very compact design (3.5-inch inner diameter by 3-inch length) to be embedded inside a rotor hub with channel noise not to exceed +/- 0.5 percent FS. To accommodate added sensors and alternate signal conditioning, the electronics should be modular and scalable, that is, multiple boards may be stacked to allow over 100+ channels with integrated signal conditioning for either high frequency (150 kHz) constant current RTD devices, constant voltage pressure transducers (150 kHz), or miniature thermocouples (up to 20 kHz). Data at max sampling rate needs to be acquired for at least 2.5 s and may be stored in memory on-shaft for post-acquisition download either via digital transmission through a smaller slip ring or wireless telemetry. All data channels must be simultaneously sampled at 16-bit minimum (24 bit preferred). Remote software should allow limited programmable settings such as channel gain (1 to 1000) and anti-alias cutoff frequency (25-150 kHz). Channel expansion beyond 80 channels may be allowed by extending the 3 inch axial length with an expandable modular design. Following initial prototype testing, the device will be demonstrated with fully-instrumented hardware at the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) Turbine Research Facility at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB), Ohio. The new capability may then serve multiple dual-use military and commercial applications (i.e., turbomachinery, such as fans, compressors, or turbines; landing gear; rotary aircraft; and various land-based vehicles and power systems).\n\nTo successfully perform the work described in this topic area, offerors may request to utilize unique facilities/equipment in the possession of the U.S. Government located onsite at WPAFB.

The UAVs will be required to perform weapons delivery and RF functions, including wide-area search and track, signals intelligence, electronic warfare, and communications functions. The UAVs will be carried in, and launched from a mothership and possess the range capability to return to a safe recovery point. The mothership and mission establishes the following requirements and design constraints: \n\nUAV (in captive carry): \n- Length: 270 inches max\n- Diameter: 30 inches max\n- Max weight: 3,700 lb max\n- Range: 2000 miles \n- Endurance: 12 hours on station. \n\nThe stressing requirements for flight performance and RF functions will require a highly integrated UAV airframe design concept to minimize weight and drag, maximize RF performance, and maximize loiter time.  In addition, the UAV will be required to reconfigure from a carry configuration to efficient configurations for cruise and loiter on station.\n\nStructural weight can be minimized by the application of unitized bonded composites, or large resin-transfer-molded structural assemblies.   Specific consideration should be given to the aerostructural design approach.  Concepts that permit stowage of a large adaptive wing configuration that can be deployed to achieve a very high lift-to-drag ratio should be considered as a primary risk center for development.  Aerostructural design requirements may require the use of aeroelastic control to improve drag efficiency and limit maximum structural design loads.  Given that these vehicles will likely possess a limited life, design criteria should be tailored, the airframe design should be considered attritable, and cost should be considered a primary design driver.\n\nTo support the RF functions, the UAV will need a large number of antennas and arrays that are as large as possible for maximum gain and field of view. A primary technical challenge is to integrate the antennas with a UAV structure as efficiently as possible to minimize drag and maximize loiter and payload potential. Past and on-going research shows antennas that are conformal and part of the loadbearing structure minimize integration weight and drag penalties and provide extensive RF capability.",

These thrust chambers will ultimately have mechanical, thermal and flow field interactions. This activity is an attempt to both model analytically the conditions relevant to these interactions and also to design and test a multiple of thrust cells, typically five, in order to establish a relationship between the analytical models and the experimental results.\n\nOne possible way to decrease the cost of liquid rocket engines is to decrease the chamber pressure for the combustion devices. Higher pressure affords higher efficiency for an engine but it comes at a higher production cost. One reason the cost scales with pressure is the complexity required of the turbomachinery to spin faster while keeping the weight to an acceptable level. Another reason is that higher pressure operation often results on higher heat loads to the walls of the combustion chamber which in turn requires more cooling to maintain mechanical integrity and hence more pressure drop on the cooling circuits.\n\nThis effort should focus on modular rocket engine concepts that operate at lower chamber pressures than state of the art oxygen rich-stage combustion engines and, if possible, using cooling schemes that can result in lower pressure drops than conventional regenerative schemes (i.e., transpiration cooling).\n\nEither conventional or additive manufacturing can be proposed for the development of the individual thrust cells, injector and nozzles.  It is expected that CFD will be used to complete the modeling of the flowfield interactions. Other relevant software packages can be used to determine the mechanical loads, thermal environments, etc.\n\nThe propellant combination will be LOX/Hydrocarbon with regeneratively cooled thrust chambers.  Thrust levels and performance parameters will be based on a sector from a subscale engine with a total thrust of 50,000 lbf (sea level).

            "description": "Military GPS receivers are unlike any other cryptography-based system in the Department of Defense (DoD).  Nearly every weapon system in DoD uses GPS, the host equipment must be unclassified, and military receivers are exported to over 55 authorized nations.  GPS is a broadcast system, with receivers passively receiving the encrypted signal.  The encryption does not primarily protect classified information, as a communication system does, but provides Transmission Security (TRANSEC) to support military exclusivity \u2013 ensuring U.S. and Allied forces have access to the signal with the assurance that an adversary does not.  Furthermore, GPS utilizes \u201cblack\u201d keys \u2013 encrypted keys that can be transmitted unclassified over the air.  This adds a requirement that each receiver include a key decryption capability buried within a secure module protected by anti-tamper.\n\nThese security requirements for GPS place a heavy burden on GPS User Equipment to protect CPI within the receiver, driving up the Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWAP-C) of military receivers while exposing the CPI to exploitation should the receivers find themselves in enemy hands.  With most GPS receivers now integrated into systems with tactical or strategic communications capability, and the advent of advanced Information Assurance (IA) techniques for protecting access to classified systems, a new approach is desirable that combines operational concepts, technology, and connectivity to enhance the protection of GPS CPI while reducing the hardware burden on military GPS receivers.\n\nThis SBIR will develop an ephemeral security overlay for fielded GPS receivers.  The purpose of the ephemeral attribute is to eliminate permanence of the CPI within the GPS receiver \u2013 all critical data will exist temporarily and be removed automatically at the end of a session.  Modern techniques to maintain control and allow access by the military receivers to the military signals should be evaluated, including location-based access (receivers purge data outside of an authorized region), biometrics (only authorized users may initialize a receiver), and advanced key distribution and protection concepts.  The availability of a network should be assumed, and should form the foundation for the overlay architecture.  No changes to the GPS satellites, GPS control segment, or GPS cryptography should be considered \u2013 instead, this architecture should be an overlay that augments the existing security architecture.",

AFSCN sites are subject to interference from terrestrial and aerial radio emitters and could potentially become jamming targets during potential future conflicts. The labor-intensive and high-latency radio interference monitoring capabilities available such as the AFSCN Link Protection System (ALPS) and direction-finder antenna suites, in conjunction with human-in-the-loop decision support systems, make it impractical to detect and respond to elusive and adaptive radio threats. This topic of solicitation will seek innovative automated solutions that will overcome the current limitations associated with ALPS; e.g., time latency and manpower required to localize radio interferences and thus, responsively mitigating operational risks of satellite operations. Specifically, the methodologies used in the ALPS should be leveraged in any proposed advances. Also relevant are potential capabilities to predict the impacts of radio interferences from terrestrial or aerial sources on space-to-ground-link-systems (SGLS).  A technical challenge is how to accurately provide situational assessment for radio frequency interference and attribute it to a particular threat situation. This requires space domain understanding of threat conditions with possible courses of action.  Providing output data in an intuitive fashion for operator understand should be considered.\n\nThe solution should automate the manual process by automatically using the azimuth and dBm values from ALPS and automatically calculate possible distances using operator input of possible emitter amplitude(s) and import a product as a kml or kmz into Google Earth on NIPR or SIPR.\n\nThis will cut down man hours (1-2 hours per stationary emitter, or 3-5 hours per aerial emitter) and allow research into source identifying the emitter much sooner and mitigate operational risk to satellite operations. Additionally, this will supplement ongoing space situational awareness during non-interference periods of operations and will help facilitate defensive space control operations during periods of interference.",

These atomic-based devices require very stable laser sources. This topic focuses on demonstrating a laser system that can provide high frequency and intensity stability in harsh conditions over the many years operating life of a sensor. \n\nAn ideal system should output >500 mW of light to the atoms (after required optical isolation, spatial filtering, frequency modulation, and optical path routing). This power would be stable to better than 20 microwatts. The laser system should be turnkey, able to lock itself and stay frequency locked to a Doppler free atomic transition and the laser line width should be narrower than the natural line width of the atomic transition. As a starting point, 100 kHz laser line width would be acceptable to many applications. The system should reliably maintain stable operation for 10 years or more. Current state of the art is only a few years and then only with significant power drift. \n\nCurrent systems are generally based on diode laser technology. Diode lasers, as well as many other gain mediums, exhibit \u201cmode hops\u201d that entail large intensity and frequency excursions of a few percent in power and several GHz in frequency. Such excursions cannot be tolerated. The laser system here will need to be inherently and demonstrably mode hop free for 10 years or find some approach to predictively mitigate hops before they can cause discontinuity in the output such as in Reference 2. If the system departs from the design wavelength, automatic recognition and relocking will be required. If an individual laser source cannot meet the lifetime goals, then redundant sources should be used and a seamless handoff employed. Size, Weight, Power and Cost (SWaP-C) considerations are important therefore if something other than a direct diode approach is taken, such as a solid state laser or a frequency doubled telecom laser, then then the SWaP-C should be justifiable. \n\nClearly a 10 year test is outside the scope of a SBIR, so accelerated life tests should be considered. The system output should not deviate under vibrations, temperature swings, radiation dose, magnetic fields, or any other environmental conditions encountered in any space orbit as outlined below: \nTemperature: -5 to 30 C, cycling at 2 C/hour \nVibration: 5 g rms 20 Hz to 2 kHz \nRadiation: 300 kRad (Proton \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nominal 63MeV, or Ionizing), Prompt dose of 1E10 rads (Si)/sec dose rate) \nMagnets: 10 gauss peak to peak fluctuations.",

In addition, the new High Accuracy Catalog (HAC) is expected to produce an estimated 400,000 element sets a day. As these two efforts come on line, the operator will soon be presented with 15,000 conjunctions a week to screen and monitor. With each conjunction the operator must determine the likelihood of the conjunction, the associated risk level, and the appropriate course of action. When determining the likelihood of a conjunction, today, the operator primarily considers two factors: probability of collision and miss distance. Each of these metrics has their own inherent problems. Miss distance cannot be solely considered since two conjuncting assets may have a miss distance less than 20 km however if the covariance matrix for each object is small then the risk factor of the conjunction is relatively small. Conversely, the miss distance could also be large, but if the covariance matrix for one of the objects is larger than the miss distance between the two objects then the conjunction still has a relatively high risk factor. There are similar concerns when considering probability of collision. In addition a covariance matrix does not fully take into account raw sensor data and its biases.  Typically the raw sensor data is fused into a flawed derived orbital product. A low probability of collision can result from both an unlikely event and a large covariance matrix. Physical object characteristics need to also be considered. An active asset conjuncting with a large secondary object is much more critical than two rocket bodies conjuncting and likewise two rocket bodies conjuncting is more important to track than say two small <10 cm pieces of debris. Each of those conjunctions has vastly different courses of action. The first conjunction has a direct impact on the mission and may require the asset to maneuver. The second conjunction is less critical than the first however it is still important to track since it has the potential to create a large amount of new debris that could later affect the mission. The third conjunction is of very little importance. This is a very involved process for the operators to conduct against the hundred or so conjunction events currently seen each week. This is an impossible task for the operators when considering 15,000 events a week. Methods need to be developed to determine which of those conjunctions are most critical and probable. Using raw sensor data feeds along with better use of data once catalog is processed will ease this problem.  A capability needs to be developed that will filter the information presented to the operator down from the 15,000 conjunctions/week to only the conjunctions with high risk factors and impact factors. The capability also needs to be very dependable in the sense that the operator needs to be able to trust that the system is presenting to the operator the most likely and highest risk conjunctions, and not filtering out any events that will eventually be an issue.",

They are also used for down converting the energy produced by the solar arrays for delivery to the various loads on the spacecraft.  While these converters traditionally operate at temperatures around 80 degrees centigrade, with convertor efficiencies ranging from 80 percent to 90 percent. Advanced technology switching devices that are becoming available will allow high-temperature operation and reduced switching losses. These devices, such as GaN HEMTs or SiC JFETs, have been shown to be inherently radiation hard, which should increase the overall converter hardness and reduce the radiation shielding requirements.\n\nThe challenge for this technology development is to demonstrate that a DC-DC converter can be developed to operate with power stage semiconductor switch junction temperatures between 200 and 250 degrees centigrade. The DC-DC converter should be suitable for use on large communications spacecraft with converter efficiencies greater than 95 percent, and specific power of 1kW/kg. We are primarily interested in large satellites so the converter modules should be scalable for use in 5 to 30 kW power systems; however, supporting smaller platforms (<100 kg) is also of interest assuming we maintain flexibility to scale to larger systems. There are many applications for DC-DC converters in spacecraft with a different input voltage and one or more output voltages. One up-converting application would be to boost the voltage of a Nickel-Hydrogen or Li-Ion battery to match that of the spacecraft bus. For this application input voltages may vary from the 30 to 50 VDC range and the output voltage would be in the 70 to 120 VDC range. The specific input voltages and output voltages would depend upon the spacecraft power system design, which could vary with each spacecraft prime contractor. A second application of DC-DC converters would be to convert the spacecraft bus voltage to voltages acceptable for each payload element. Many payloads have DC-DC converters that have multiple output voltages. Typical output voltages are +/- 1.0, 5, 10, 15 VDC. The design must provide high efficiency at all points of load. The technology proposed should be capable of performing at least one of these two converter functions in a spacecraft application.\n\nThe DC-DC converter should be capable of supporting a 15-year mission in Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) or Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) and 5 years in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) after storage on the ground for 5 years. It should function after 500 kRad (Si) total dose, be immune to dose rate and single event latchup, and not upset at a single event LET lower than 20 Mev/mg/cm2.",

Additionally, better performance over a wider temperature range may allow distributed power architectures without the use or need of active cooling/heating, reducing mass and power consumption.  However, ultracapacitors do not have high specific energy.  Current production ultracapacitors are < 10 Wh/kg.  For certain spacecraft applications, pulsed power profiles can be expected.  These high power, short duration events may be deleterious to the lifetime of a traditional battery.  To maximize end of life battery performance, the Air Force would like a spacecraft power system architecture that includes an energy buffer such as an ultracapacitor in the electrical power system at the location of these intermittent loads to ameliorate the effects of short duration high rate discharge cycles on the batteries.  Because of pulsed power demands, spacecraft wiring harness must be sized to supply the high currents that these loads require adding significant mass to the spacecraft wiring harness. The location of an energy buffer at these loads (distributed energy storage) would allow spacecraft designers to size the power supply wiring for the average load required by the payload reducing wire size and mass.\n\nExamples of peak loads are:\n1) An electric thruster used for station-keeping or attitude control. Electric thrusters used in this manner would have step loads in the range of 1 kW for durations ranging from a few seconds to a maximum of one minute.\n2) Ordinance firing loads which are in the range of 250 amps with duration of 250 milliseconds.\n3) Event driven high power RF transmitters, which burst data for short durations. These transmitters would have step loads up to 1 kW for durations of one to five minutes.\n\nThe end goal of this technology will be as a distributed hybrid energy storage system with the capability of supporting a 15-year mission in Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) and five years in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) after five years of ground storage.  In order for the ultracapacitor distributed energy storage architecture to be feasibile, it is required that the ultracapacitor have specific energy > 50 Whr/kg, specific power > 10 kW/kg, cycle life of > 500,000, and operating range of -40 degrees C to +80 degrees C.",

The telephone, which started out as a non-portable analog device, has become one of the most common digital computing systems in use with the development of the smartphone. Digital computers have dominated the market over analog computers due to speed, size, cost, etc. However, while digital processing offers many advantages over analog processing, analog devices cannot be eliminated completely. One major area still dominated by analog is data transmission. Data is commonly transmitted and received over radio frequency (RF) waves. This includes modern telephone systems, radio broadcasts, military devices such as RADARs, satellite communications, etc. While the data being processed inside each of these is digital, the data coming in and going out is still analog.\n\nIn order for analog data to be digitally processed or for digital data to be broadcast over an analog wave, there must be bridges between analog and digital. These bridges consist of Analog to Digital Converters (ADC) and Digital to Analog Converters (DAC). As technology has progressed, the need for ADCs and DACs with higher resolutions, better Signal to Noise Ratios (SNR), and faster sampling rates has greatly increased. Also, with the development of smaller, portable devices, the size, weight and power of these ADCs and DACs needs to be reduced.\n\nThe focus of this topic is the DAC for space applications. Current RH DACs have about 12 bit resolution, and operate in the Mega-Samples per Second (MSPS) range. Commercial DACs (Non-RH) can have 16 bit resolutions while operating in the GSPS range. There is a need for good resolution (at least 12 bits), high speed (at least 2GSPS), RH DACs to support new satellite developments. These DACs must balance the tradeoffs between speed, resolution, noise, and SWaP. The SNR should be 70dB or better and the SFDR should be 80dB or better.\n\nThe radiation-hardness requirements for the RH DAC are: \nEffect: Units: Level: \nTotal Ionizing Dose rad(Si) 10e6 \nSingle-Event Upset Err/bit-day 10e-10 \nSingle-Event Latchup None \nDose-Rate Upset rads(Si)/s 10e10 \nDose-Rate Survivability rads(Si)/s 10e12 \n\nProposals should clearly indicate how the result of the effort would be shown to improve the MILSATCOM and GPS system's capabilities through a test and validation plan. Testing and validation of risk reduction components of the overall effort in Phase I is encouraged.\n\nOfferers are encouraged to work with MILSATCOM and PNT system prime contractors to help ensure applicability of their efforts and begin work towards technology transition.\n\nOfferers should clearly indicate in their proposals what government furnished property or information are required for effort success.

One area of interest for improvement in the transport of heat from source-to-sink is the heat spreader beneath the high power density GaN PA packaged device.  Current power densities at the bottom of the PA device can exceed 62 W/cm2 and are expected to climb to values >1400 W/cm2 in the next five to six years.  At these expected power densities, it is apparent a new high power density heat spreader will be required to bridge the gap between future expected power densities and the power densities our current systems can handle.\n\nThe High Power Density Structural Heat Spreader shall provide a reduction in power density by almost 250 times.  Future power densities of GaN PA devices will exceed 1400 W/cm2 (600W over 0.635 cm x 0.635 cm).  It is desired to have a heat spreader that can evenly distribute this heat to the heat sink with a resulting heat flux of no more than 62 W/cm2 (threshold) to 6.2 W/cm2 (objective).  The resultant temperature drop across the heat spreader from (hot spot to bottom of the spreader) shall be no more than 25 degrees C (threshold) or 10 degrees C (objective).  At a minimum the heat spreader must accommodate one heat source; however, we are also interested in technologies that can be scaled up to the panel level and accommodate multiple heat sources.  Finally, since mass is critical for all space systems, low mass solutions that provide structural support are of interest.\n\nThe high power density heat spreader shall operate in a space environment (vacuum and no gravity), as well as on Earth in any orientation with respect to gravity for ground testability.  At a minimum, the heat spreader shall meet the performance goals over an operating temperature range of 0 degrees C to 80 degrees C and a survival temperature range of -60 degrees C to 100 degrees C.  However, operational temperatures up to 150 degrees C are also of great interest.

Additionally, the space environment, and in particular the Geostationary orbit, is becoming increasingly congested and contested.  To ensure the continued operation of the Air Force\u2019s global space missions (Missile Warning, Military Satellite Communications, and Precision Navigation and Timing) we require space systems capable of acting/reacting within the timelines dictated by expected hazards and threats.  However, this protective capability must also be properly balanced against mission requirements and system resource limitations, to prevent the unnecessary depletion of said resources or impacts to the mission (e.g. ambiguous sensor readings lead the satellite to maneuver which in turn reduces the system\u2019s station keeping capability, effectively shortening the satellite\u2019s service life).\n\nThe Air Force Research Laboratory believes that enabling these protective responses at a temporally effective pace will require increased levels of system autonomy to identify, assess,  recommend, and eventually choose, plan and execute appropriate protective courses of action.  AFRL also believes that, similar to all other warfighting domains subject to \u201cthe fog of war,\u201d that operators and (eventually) systems will have to make these choices in the presence of incomplete and/or low quality sets of data and information.  AFRL\u2019s efforts to enable more autonomous space systems, is broken into the four following, yet highly coupled, areas:\n1)  Sensor Data Fusion: Integration of data from multiple sources, in order to properly assess the situation.  The data can be from on-board sensors and satellite payloads, in addition to external sources of information (such as Space Situational Awareness information products from a Space Operations Center).\n2)  System Management: Housekeeping operations to keep the space vehicle operating.  Examples include controlling the charging and discharging of batteries, rotation of the solar arrays to maintain alignment with the sun, powering heaters to keep components from getting to cold, etc.\n3)  Course of Action (COA) Selection: Selecting the appropriate COA that a) minimizes the effects from the threat/hazard, b) maximizes attainment of mission requirements, and c) minimizes resource depletion.  Requires multivariable optimization, in a noisy environment, with incomplete or missing information.\n4)  Mission Planning: Once a COA has been selected, developing the set of procedures required to execute that COA.\n\nThis topic is focused specifically on COA selection, although some work may be extensible to other areas.\n\nTo enable efficient and effective COA selection, AFRL is interested in the following (non-inclusive) technology areas: \n1)  Hypothesis development and rejection, to quickly populate, and then reduce, the set of likely anomalies and satisfactory responses.\n2)  Sensor or system tasking to generate, or gather, the most critical pieces of information that are currently lacking.  Such taskings must also consider the temporal aspects of the information requirements. \n3)  Ensuring stability in under-defined and noisy mathematical systems.\n\nSince the intent is to transition the technology into operational satellites, preference will be shown to those proposals that demonstrate traceability to the size, weight and power (SWAP) and computational limits of current and/or future space processing architectures.",

Some studies are available but their applicability and orbit regimes are typically limited.  The manner in which data is collected contributes to or detracts from overall situational awareness.  Current methods may only stare at a particular part of the orbit regime for a given time then postulate on the orbit population via uniform or other statistical distribution which could introduce characterization error if the fundamental motion of the objects is not appropriately considered.\n\nThis topic seeks to undertake this challenge of characterization the population of artificial space objects utilizing on-orbit sensing.  However, there is a limit to the type and number of sensors that can be carried by an orbiting platform. Given this limitation, appropriately choosing particular on-orbit sensors and combinations thereof that deliver the most accurate and timely knowledge is required.  With the chosen sensor suite(s), tasking algorithms are required to fully exploit the information offered by sensors operating in different modalities.  It is important to demonstrate what could be achieved given the current state of space qualified sensors as well as demonstrate what level of characterization could be achieved via appropriate data fusion and sensor tasking strategies.\n\nThe fundamental requirement for this activity to be successful is to explore methods that maximize the probability of detection for resident space objects, which may or may not be hard to detect, as well as be able to revisit populations of interest for catalog maintenance.  Multi-modal sensing is required as when the probability of detection in one frequency or wavelength may go to zero while it may go toward unity in another modality. Once detectability is maximized, the next area to pursue is what can be inferred from these sensor detections. Physical characteristics are commonly of interest (e.g., size, shape, materials, orbit, orientation, etc.) but even further, functional characteristics are of interest (e.g., mission, capabilities) so that situational awareness can be appropriately and reliably quantified.

These systems sense airframe attitude, through measurement of the relative angular position of known celestial objects, and position, if a reference frame relative to the local horizontal can be inferred. Since these systems directly impact accuracy of closed-loop guidance, a capability to test them as an integral part of the guidance system, i.e., hardware-in-the-loop simulation, is desired. Development of advanced star trackers for use in manned aircraft, remotely piloted aircraft (RPAs) and weapons will require a hardware-in-the-loop capability to integrate, test, and calibrate the system on the ground. This technology could also be used to support commercial interests, such as testing trackers for use in commercial maritime, aviation, and space navigation applications.\n\nA number of challenges exist that exceed the capability of current hardware-in-the-loop simulators.  Optical representation of star maps with radiometric accuracy is required in the visible through the short wave infrared spectrum. Collimated representation of the star field is required to sub-microradian accuracy. These advancements will require innovative solutions to extend scene generation capabilities to shorter wavelengths with increased contrast (greater than 2000:1).\n\nCapability is needed to represent the sky and stellar background including for a wide range of day and night celestial objects, backgrounds and optical distortions.  Representation of atmospheric objects (clouds, aerosols, etc.) and scatter along with possible interference of earth/sea glint and earth limb must also be considered. It is also a goal to provide radiometrically adjustable targets.  In other words, it would be nice to have the ability to accurately simulate star color in the scene generator.\n\nThese advancements will require innovative solutions to extend scene generation capabilities to shorter wavelengths with increased contrast (much greater than 2000:1), represent point source angular position to higher accuracy (about 100 urad) over a large field of view (greater than 20 degrees), and to represent a broad spectrum of airframe motion to navigation accuracy (greater than 400 deg/sec). Dynamic representation of stellar objects including Sun (V.M. -26), Moon, stars and space objects ranging from Magnitude 15 to Mag  -4+ are needed.  The need for objects with static magnitudes and temporally modulated magnitudes is also anticipated.\n\nInnovative solutions are being sought that will allow the insertion of celestial navigation systems, including associated inertial measurement units, into a hardware-in-the-loop test environment. While complete solution concepts are strongly encouraged and will be given priority, partial capabilities that describe one or more of the identified challenges will also be considered. Anticipated solutions range from complete environmental simulation using hardware simulators, to full or partial digital injection capabilities if hardware solutions are unreasonable.\n\nDynamics of the platforms under consideration deviate in major ways from traditional stellar inertial instrument application for attitude control on stable satellite platforms.  A star tracker for use in manned aircraft, RPAs and weapons will require a much more robust dynamic environment for targets and backgrounds due to the missile and aircraft high G dynamics and severe flight vibrations to be replicated during star tracker testing. Some instrument concepts under consideration require stimulation of the star field at up to 800 frames per seconds to reduce air frame vibration effects at high Mach number.\n\nThe approach should represent point source angular position to higher accuracy (less than 100 microradians) over a large field of view (greater than 20 degrees), and to represent a broad spectrum of airframe motion to navigation accuracy. Goals include to provide image motion rates of more than 400 deg/second in a random direction to represent actual flight dynamics of an airborne missile platform.  The number and type of targets to be projected or simulated and the approach for quasistatic and dynamic stellar objects must be addressed to provide a representative number of objects in the stellar instrument field of view.\n\nOther considerations include angular static accuracy measurement.  Calibration of the instrument in a very high fidelity angular measurement system \u2013 something that is capable of calibrating to 5-10X better than what is required on the star tracker.

This problem is only expected to worsen as weapon velocities and strength of materials in targets increase.\n\nOne approach is to use an interior structure in the warhead cavity that would reduce movement and displacement in the explosive during penetration.  There are two ways this might be implemented: (1) the explosive might fill an open cellular structure like a linear cellular array [Ref. 1] and/or an open cell foam [Ref. 2, 3], or (2) the explosive might be subdivided into discrete modules or compartmentalized by baffles or barriers.  The intent in the first approach is to reduce explosive movement by increasing case-explosive bonding -- through increased  surface area or increased bond interface strength, or both -- without creating friction that might generate hot spots and inadvertent ignition.  The intent in the second approach is to manage axial movement of the explosive by distributing a portion of the loads radially rather than axially.\n\nThese cases might be all metal structures or composite structures made of multiple materials.   Metal structures might be created by traditional machining processes, additive manufacturing processes [Ref. 4], advanced casting processes, or a combination of these methods. The cases might be monolithic or composed of multiple parts (e.g., a thin-walled case with liners or inserts). \n\nThese novel warhead cases should have mass-to-charge ratios that are equivalent to (or preferably, lower than) traditional unitary cases.  Simply replacing explosive mass with additional (inert) structure is not a valid solution since this would have a negative effect on blast lethality.  Structural energetic materials [Ref. 5] might be used in the interior structure to mitigate this effect.\n\nThe proposal should address scalability and affordability of the proposed concept given reasonable technology maturation and advances.\n\nThe approaches discussed above are not meant to constrain other innovative concepts.

            "description": "Weapons undergo long duration, high amplitude, multiaxial decelerations during the penetration of targets. This imparts momentum on the entire weapon system which is correspondingly reduced due to the penetration resistance of the target. Even for the rigid body (i.e., ignoring flexible body dynamics), the inertial deceleration forces can exceed 10,000 g's (gravitational acceleration) and remain above that threshold over a long duration, often well in excess of 5 ms. Adding to the harshness of the environment is the multiaxial nature of the loading, which includes both bending and shear moments. The most extreme example is in \"tail slap,\" where large lateral accelerations are introduced due to the bending and rebound of the weapon in the lateral direction (i.e., perpendicular to the axis of penetration). Developing a controllable test method and predictive capability to apply this environment in testing is critical to the development of fuze, energetic, and other weapon technologies. However, the corresponding change in velocity typically requires ballistic or operational testing. Both testing methods are extremely costly, personnel intensive, and introduce both technical and safety risks. It is therefore desirable to develop a low-cost, reusable testing method (and accompanying experimental and simulation capabilities) that can reproduce acceleration/time profiles representative of penetration (amplitude for a duration, or equivalently the integrated velocity change) in opposing (shock-countershock) and multiple directions (multiaxial) for a sizable test article (threshold 10 lbs., objective 250 lbs.). \n\nPractical test considerations also impose additional requirements beyond the required multiaxial acceleration/duration performance. Most tests call for more sensor channels than are recordable in an onboard recording system. In these instances, a nearly-stationary (i.e., \u201cpseudo-static\u201d) test article is typically used.  An additional benefit is that off-board instrumentation is able to collect more channels of data with higher precision and sampling rates. One example of a pseudo-static testing is reverse ballistics where a target is propelled into a stationary UUT.  Finally, a scalable solution will enable testing of both small UUTs and larger test vehicles, with an objective of testing large size (>6 in. diameter) subscale weapons (with weights approaching 250 lbs.). \n\nThe ability to accurately model both the test conditions and the test article is critical to a successful effort. A virtual model of the system should be built as part of the development and subsequently used for predictive analysis. The model will be used for designing experiments to tune experiments to minimize the number of tests needed to accomplish the objectives. A validated model will also have enduring benefit for evaluating the survivability of candidate weapon technologies (e.g., fuze electronics) in this extremely harsh environment. \n\nThe technical effort (both experimental and computational) will focus on a non-inventory subscale warhead to demonstrate the viability of the approach and maximize its utility in early weapon system research and development. The government will provide the design details for the subscale system, including drawings of the system as well as the available material properties, as GFI in this effort. Operation and demonstration of the system at government test facilities may also be required due to security considerations.",

Small and agile munitions require precision guidance capability to maneuver in obstruction-rich and highly cluttered urban, suburban, foliage rich and mountainous environments to engage mobile targets. The loss/degradation of GPS and communications encountered in military operations and intermittent line-of-sight to the target add additional seeker system challenges. Precision guidance is tightly coupled to lethality in that small weapons must achieve a small Circular Area Probability (CEP) to accommodate small warheads, while maintaining a high probability of kill (Pk).\n \nHence the weapon seeker needs to have a Ka band RF seeker that has added discrimination to enable performance in challenging environments to include attenuation due to rain.

            "description": "Future hard-target munitions will be used in cooperative ways and will require multi-strike tactics to functionally or structurally defeat hard targets, such as RC bunkers. The current Air Force Modular Effectiveness Vulnerability Assessment (MEVA) tool implements wall damage response in a limited parameter space (unrealistic room configurations and low RC compressive strength) and provides simple metrics (no prediction of spall, breach, or secondary debris) related to global wall response for first generation computational damage approaches developed for single and multiple weapon internal detonation events that predict local response of wall materials to blast and fragments. An assortment of numerical modeling techniques have been explored and considered to characterize continuum-level damage. Innovative second-generation cumulative-damage models are now needed that can consider multi-event or multi-insult detonations in a manner that builds on current RC-damage modeling approaches. Such approaches will provide analytical data for more rigorous engineering models that can provide more detailed local and global response modes that include time dependent wall deflection, spalling, breach, secondary debris generation, and incremental wall damage state from multiple weapon detonations. These damage parameters will be needed by progressive damage models whose requirements need to be included in this effort. A final objective is to utilize the cumulative damage data sets to develop efficient engineering approximations that can be run rapidly (milliseconds to seconds) in weapon effectiveness modeling tools such as the MEVA tool. If the engineering model(s) are not run efficiently, they may be poor candidates as prediction capabilities expand to consider progressive damage and/or collapse of complex target structures. It is in the best interest of the joint weaponeering community for the engineering model of cumulative damage (multi-weapon detonation damage prediction within a complex bunker) to be seamlessly compatible with MEVA data formats. For example, DLL models are one example of a consistent data structure with MEVA.\n\nThe requirement is for the development of models that predict the specified structural damage to hardened RC-Bunker structures subjected to multiple weapon detonations and have an overall accuracy of 80 percent or better when compared to actual test data. Blast & fragment loads from current & future penetrator weapons will produce the required loads. Quantification of modeling uncertainty and a representation of the models\u2019 predictive accuracy based on that uncertainty [1, 2] is required. This should include cumulative damage uncertainty.\n\nThe response of the models should address both air-backed and soil-backed walls, roofs and floors, including soil-structure interaction effects. In addition, the models should be able to handle the different room & hallway configurations typically found in bunkers (realistic bunker layouts). The resulting models will need to be integrated into the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) MEVA architecture and have execution times similar to current models. The bunker structural configuration and the loads acting on the structural components will be provided as inputs from MEVA.  In addition, the contractor should propose a limited set of test experiments that he can perform to validate his algorithms.  If necessary, government test facilities and or test data will be provided if requested and within the government\u2019s funding constraints.

            "description": "Ground-based kinetic weapons pose spontaneous and unpredictable threats to aircraft. They may be optically (lens) equipped/assisted or man-guided.\n\nThese weapons must be detected within 360 degrees of the aircraft using existing onboard aircraft EO/IR sensor systems. Light weight, low cost, small form factor, minimum power solutions are needed that may be integrated with existing aircraft systems to minimize impacts to current aircraft configurations.\n\nPrecision location of threats is required in order to effect neutralization through onboard countermeasures. The sensor system will have the ability to detect muzzle flash and rapidly provide geo-location, allowing the non-lethal neutralization of the threat. Additionally the system will have the ability to actively detect optically sighted systems, geo-locate, and provide a non-lethal countermeasure prior to the weapon being fired. Threat geo-location and direction of fire solely for the purpose of evasion are not of interest. The system should be able to detect and neutralize multiple threats simultaneously. The sensor is desired to be able to detect and discriminate small arms fire at altitudes up to and beyond 10000 feet.  It is desired that the sensor system be able to detect and discriminate larger munitions such as rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), mortars, AAA (anti-aircraft guns), and surface-to-air missiles (SAM) at altitudes up to 35000 feet.  It is highly desirable that the system provide non-imaging and imaging levels of capability with non-cryogenically sensor systems.  There are currently no non-cryogenic, low-cost hostile fire systems which are successfully fielded for this effort.\n\nPrevious sensor have been developed and tested for lower altitude unmanned air systems (UAS) but are large, expensive and lower sensitivity than needed for high altitude UAS operation. Previous approaches have also been subject to glint false alarms and unable to accurately discriminate type of event or friendly vs enemy fire. Basic sensing technologies and signal processing algorithms and subsystems have reduced size, weight, and power (SWaP) required for a hostile fire detection sensor to within the capabilities of many current and near-term remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) platforms to perform this mission. RPAs are becoming the primary platforms for persistent battlefield surveillance and the requirement for extended time on station determines to a great extent the available weight allocation for any hostile fire sensor system. Future RPA hostile fire sensors systems will take the form of Line Replaceable Units for legacy sensor payloads currently in use on the RPA fleet. Therefore, the size, weight, and power consumption of hostile fire sensor systems must emulate that of previous generation sensor systems without hostile fire sensing capabilities. Sensor system and processor must operate with minimal operator interaction.  System must be light weight, low drag, and suitable for CV-22 helicopter, MQ1/9 and C-130 flight environments.\n\nThe hostile fire sensor system must demonstrate the capability to operate with both low false alarm rates and relatively high probability of detection under operational conditions. The additional capability to perform threat geolocation in support of not only direct attack, but indirect attack, necessitate a close coupling between the sensor system and some form of inertial measurement capability either integral to the sensor or available as part of the mission flight package for the aerial platform. Determine the feasibility of meeting various sensor performance metrics using trade-space analysis from sensor component characteristics and available field measurements of weapon signatures.\n\nThe determination of military utility of a hostile fire sensor will be heavily dependent on its capacity to distinguish between friendly and hostile fire in order to avoid fratricide. There are different levels of fidelity currently defined for hostile fire sensor systems. Most systems currently differentiate among weapon classes, but lack a significant capability to confidently declare a weapon type within a class. \nThe goal is to design a sensor system prototype system to be integrated onto a test platform for the purpose of verification of sensor capabilities under live fire test conditions. Perform modeling and analysis to show the efficacy of the approach for different classes of threat systems. The Phase I prototype design will, potentially be heavier and less capable than an operational sensor, but the design should address traceability between demonstrable SWaP and performance for the captive carry prototype and an ultimate operational configuration for the hostile fire sensor. In the Phase I it is necessary desirable to demonstrate of the critical system technology components in a laboratory or field setting. In Phase II, develop and demonstrate the prototype sensor system to support a wide field of view, live fire tower and flight test under benign battlefield conditions.",

While the late-time ( about 1 ms) species emissions are well-characterized, the early-time chemical cascade (about 1 \u00b5s) is poorly understood. Spectral feature identification and source characterization in the field is arduous due to a lack of algorithms and software that can process such data in real time. Much of the current data regarding spectroscopic features is located in texts containing information on isolated species in a laboratory environment and is often over 30 years old. The desired program will identify field-collected emission signature data and characterize its source in real time.\n\nThere are currently multiple approaches of developing such processing programs, but they are generally implemented in remote sensing, land cover classification, and protein database applications. There is a critical need for a multivariate analysis method combining various approaches such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM) to provide advanced feature extraction (FE) and learning capabilities to process the spectral information contained within the pixels of a UV/VIS/NIR spectral image. Santos et al. [Ref. 1] combined three feature representations and two learning algorithms (SVM and multilayer perception neural networks) to interpret hyperspectral data. A multivariate analytical program developed by Cerqueira et al. [Ref. 2] has utilized a database search algorithm to achieve a machine-learning technique for identification of proteins in complex mixtures. A third viable approach was implemented by Hsu and Yang [Ref. 3] that combines the advantages of ANN\u2019s with wavelet-based feature extraction wavelet network (WN) methods for data identification and classification. This topic seeks technical advancement through combination of identification and learning algorithms with real-time database construction and source characterization.\n\nThe intent of this topic is to develop appropriate algorithms and software to extract spectroscopic peak locations along a wavelength scale and identify unique features in the UV/VIS/NIR with intensity above that of signal noise and background continuum emission. The identified peak features will then be used to train an appropriate network learning algorithm to identify emission features in order to facilitate development of a database of UV/VIS/NIR spectral features characterizing chemical species found in early-time deflagration/detonation events of energetic and reactive materials. Collected data can have multiple file formats (e.g. ascii, pst, pfn) and are often converted to JCAMP-DX or FITS files in order to participate in international spectral library building efforts.

Historically, multi-criteria utility value function analyses have been accomplished through an analytic process where independent \u201ccost\u201d and \u201ceffectiveness\u201d analyses are conducted and the results combined to provide some level of \u201ccost-effectiveness\u201d insights.  The Combat Forces Assessment Model (CFAM) and STORM are two examples of useful analytic tools built for specific purposes.  CFAM\u2019s optimization problem can be formulated with alternative objective functions and constraint sets, but a typical problem is to determine the mix of munitions required to maximize the value of targets destroyed given a set of prioritized targets (by distance band and time phase) while minimizing the cost (munition and aircraft losses) of the campaign.  Although CFAM has been successfully applied to the Air Force\u2019s Nonnuclear Consumables Annual Analysis (NCAA) process, it has several limitations:  it is a one-sided, air-only linear formulation of the cost optimization problem; the set of prioritized targets (often generated from STORM-based campaign analysis outcomes) must be provided as input; and it does not directly represent the effect of ISR on the air planning and execution processes.  CFAM does not explicitly consider the operational context nor represent the inherent risk associated with countering an adaptive adversary\u2019s forces, capabilities and actions, thus limiting the cost-effectiveness insights available from the tool.\n\nOn the other end of the cost-effectiveness analytic question continuum is STORM, a campaign-level, perception-based analytic tool used by the U.S Air Force and Joint analytic communities.  STORM explicitly represents U.S. and enemy air, space, ground and naval weapons, platforms and entities; and is used to provide effectiveness insights on the contribution of their combat and support capabilities to the campaign outcome, for both U.S. and adversary forces.  The planning and execution processes dynamically react as the campaign unfolds with campaign, perception-based results (e.g., AAR support missions canceled, strike aircraft killed in the air or on the ground, air defense sites survive the A2S attack, etc.).  STORM\u2019s air planning processes interact with, affect, and are affected by other warfare functionality areas (logistics, mobility, communications, ISR/sensors, etc.), and any modifications to the air strike planning process would need to account for those relationships and dependencies.  Similarly, STORM\u2019s planning processes were designed with no consideration of cost in either the value functions or input data driving the process outcomes.  This can best be illustrated by discussing the current air strike planning process.  The user provides as input a prioritized target set as well as available air-to-surface munitions based on scenario requirements and National Command Authority/COCOM priorities.  Given air asset and air-to-surface munition availability, STORM\u2019s air strike planning process uses a target-centric, greedy heuristic to select aircraft and weapons to strike the highest priority target (representing the warfighter\u2019s strategic intent) as soon as possible, considering only if the squadron (aircraft, munition with the highest expected yield) can satisfy the target\u2019s damage requirements (with no consideration of the munition/fuel costs or the cost of expected aircraft losses).\n\nBottom-line.  This SBIR is to determine if the two aspects of a cost-informed operational effectiveness weapons analysis, previously handled separately as part of an analytic process, can be incorporated into a single tool to generate benefit-effectiveness insights that inform both the warfighters\u2019 and acquirers\u2019 decision space.",

Technologies to be investigated include designators, optics and detectors. Proposals may focus on one or all technology areas. Designators may be ground based or airborne. New designator concepts should explore the laser wavelength (the traditional 1.06/1.55 microns and others), pulse repetition frequency (10Hz to 10s of kilohertz), pulse widths and methods of lasing the target (stationary or optimized scan patterns). Optical considerations should include: 1) field of regard/view (30 degrees or greater is desired); 2) gimbal/non-gimbaled systems (traditional gimbals are discouraged due to size, weight and power; we prefer wide field of view (WFOV) optics or MEMs based optical steering); 3) optical throughput, 4) solar rejection (tracking targets in the presence of a bright background source, i.e., the sun) located at any field point greater than 2 degrees (threshold), 1 degree (objective) from the intended source; and 5) narrow band-pass filtering of the source to a 10nm (threshold), 2nm (objective) transmission bandwidth, which shall be effective throughout the entire field of regard of the seeker.

This directly impacts the size and number of air-to-ground weapons that can be carried per mission. Therefore it is highly desirable to minimize the CSWaP and maximize the munition loadout to increase sortie effectiveness. This drives weapon designers to develop smaller munitions, such as Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) and Small Diameter Bomb Increment II (SDB-II), which in turn drives an increase in the accuracy requirements and minimization of Circular Error Probable miss distance to maintain the intended weapon effectiveness.  Since these munitions will be used in highly contested air spaces, systems are expected to be lost through attrition.  This loss also drives the need to maximize loadout, to insure a sufficient number of weapons reach their desired target. With this increased number of weapons to be released, the per unit cost must be minimized.  The challenge is to develop low cost and compact RF seekers.

Structural reactive materials (SRM) provide both strength and energy release and can be used to enhance warhead lethality over traditional metallic warheads. Unlike conventional steel warheads, the lethality of SRMs is due primarily to the combustion of small particles and therefore requires an understanding of how to control the distribution of fragmentation to achieve the desired terminal effects. These materials will likely have highly anisotropic mechanical and reactive properties and have fragmentation behaviors quite different than traditional materials.\n\nComposite structures utilize manufacturing methods that produce final parts with geometries and/or thicknesses that are not amenable to industry standards in mechanical characterization. The macro-scale composite structures cannot be destructively sectioned into more standardized test specimens without detrimentally affecting the properties, resulting in inaccurate properties characterization. Additionally, the energetic nature of these materials creates a requirement for non-standard characterization equipment capable of mitigating safety hazards. Furthermore, the high pressures, loading rates, strains (deformation) and strain rates typical of advanced high speed weapons also drive unique requirements for experimentation and characterization. The development of multi-functionality in munitions, particularly with energetic materials is a relatively new field and adequate characterization is necessary for sensitivity and performance validation.\n\nThe intent of this topic is to develop material models and experimental methods and measurements to safely and accurately extract fundamental properties from as manufactured reactive material components.

Coatings are applied for environmental barrier protection to protect from the flow of harsh, corrosive gases; thermal barrier coatings to insulate and protect the base metal from large and prolonged heat loads; coatings to prevent galling or fretting where components slide while in contact with other components; and coatings used on sealing surfaces to minimize propulsive loss and maximize propulsive efficiency.  These coatings can be applied by themselves or in combination on different locations of the same component.  During the normal depot component inspection the coatings must often be removed prior to inspection of the base material.  If the component passes the inspection, it must be recoated to be put back into service.  For high value parts, this procedure is performed often.  For low value parts, it is usually more cost effective to scrap the part and purchase new since the cost to strip-inspect-recoat exceeds the 70 percent threshold of the cost of a new part.  In both cases it is desiresable to have a whole-field inspection capability to inspect the component without removal of the coating regardless of the size and geometric complexity of the component.  This will impact affordability and availability of fielded and future aerospace weapon systems by extending service life, ensuring flight safety, reducing sustainment costs, and ensuring mission readiness and capability.\n\nThe capability to inspect coated parts via vibrothermography has already been demonstrated and is successfully being used in the commercial sector.  For use in the Air Force depot, a reliability assessment must ultimately be conducted before it can be implemented.  Current state-of-the-art for any NDE reliability assessment method (e.g., eddy current testing, fluorescent penetrant testing, vibrothermography, etc.) is to produce cracks in specimens of relatively simple geometry.  Cracking is performed on specimens usually with a starter notch which is grown to a controlled size in fatigue.  The Phase I and Phase II SBIR effort is not to perform a reliability assessment.

Ceramic matrix composites (CMC) are a promising high temperature material for aerospace applications. Recently, several successful demonstrations of CMC hot section turbine engine components have been executed. There are several benefits in using CMCs over traditional Ni-based super alloys which include improved durability at elevated temperatures, increased thrust-to-weight ratio and improved specific fuel consumption. While the need for CMCs is apparent, the current transition path for materials is based on metal alloys and does not account for the unique aspects of CMCs. Innovative testing methodologies and physics based computational tools that capture relevant environmental factors while accounting for the unique aspects of CMCs are needed to fully exploit their use for hot section turbine engine components. \n\nMost of the current research and available property data on CMCs are based on flat panel coupon testing. However, CMC components in advanced turbine engine applications are highly complex. Components such as turbine blades and vanes require ply drops, curved plies, and/or matrix rich regions which have not been studied extensively. Additionally, the complexity of the CMCs architecture could cause other manufacturing defects such as porosity and ply wrinkles that can affect component durability. These components also face combined mechanical loading and thermal gradients resulting in complex stress states that are not captured in most standard tests.  Combined environmental and mechanical damage will have a significant impact on CMC component life. \n\nThe evaluation of CMC turbine engine components in relevant service environments requires the application of extreme environments (high pressure, hot gases and moisture) and complex loads (bi-axial, vibratory and thermal gradients). Despite using established testing methods designed for metals throughout the component\u2019s building block development (coupons, sub-elements, sub-scale components, etc.), unanticipated failures still occur when the hardware is rolled up into a complete full scale engine demonstrator test in part due to the complexity of the loading and service environment. Preexisting service damage also impacts the service life CMC components.\n\nConsequently, new and innovative methods are needed to verify the anticipated component performance and generate confidence in new designs and technologies as early in the development process as possible, while providing a reduction in cost and test time prior to their introduction into full-scale engines.  Currently, empirical curves are generated from design allowables of flat panels to life CMC components. The current approach requires a prolonged development time and does not capture the complexity of CMC components. The preferred method will combine experimental and analytical aspects with the goal of developing lifing tools to reduce the amount of testing needed and capture the complexity of CMCs. The proposed method needs to predict the service life of CMC engine components within a determined fidelity of prediction. It also should focus on first order effects that limit service life. The proposed method can also provide insight into potential issues in the full-scale engine. Approaches will directly address and support DoD\u2019s next generation of propulsion technology initiatives, such as ADVENT and AETD within the VAATE program.",

Commercial aircraft have also exhibited corrosion under similar aluminum/ aluminum stack-ups.  Corrosion results from the intrusion of water at gaps between exterior panels.  These gaps are filled with a polymeric material that cracks allowing water to wick into the interface forming a galvanic couple.  Current inspections remove the surface layer to inspect the underlying structure.  While effective, this method is very time consuming and costly.  Traditional eddy current and ultrasound approaches have been used to detect corrosion beneath the surface layer but have proven ineffective.

A critical facet of this damage tolerant design approach is nondestructive inspection.

While this approach is effective, the maintenance burden associated with repeated inspections can be problematic for some platforms. The inspections can be difficult and significant disassembly of the structure can be required to gain access to the inspection areas. Since there are typically many inspection points on an aircraft, this can result in significant cost and downtime for the aircraft. \n\nUnconventional approaches to facilitate or replace these aircraft structural inspections,compatible with the US Air Force Aircraft Structural Integrity Program are desired. developed technologies are expected to include, but are not limited to. various forms of in-situ, nondestructive inspection techniques.

Specific capabilities must address variability and complexity found in typical aircraft structure, such as joints, irregular geometry, and time varying / stochastic boundary conditions.  For these reasons, baseline comparison methods are not of interest unless they address the stochastic instability of the baseline condition and its influence of the probability of detection of the damage detection system.

Unfortunately, experimentally determined modal properties are rarely presented with any quantified statistical confidence or uncertainty. This is primarily due to the extensive amount of data reduction that must be accomplished to estimate modal properties from excitation and response measurements.

AFFF is the current state of the art method, however, Air Force Special Operations Command's Pararescue (PJ) community has placed an additional requirement of insulating or cooling objects/materials to create a path to recovery and allow for human contact with the fire affected area.\n\nBoth the agent and the delivery system have been identified as areas for improvement. The main focus of this effort is expected to be development of the agent. The agent developed should have the ability to suppress fires, both Class A (ordinary combustibles) and Class B (fuel fires). The agent should also insulate or cool materials, allowing personnel to access scenes where both fire and heat are a force protection issue.\n\nIt is expected that insulation is a more feasible approach to protecting the user from heat from objects. Metals have a high thermal mass and high conductivity, so it is unlikely to be able to cool an entire structure. It may be possible to insulate surfaces in a layer of an agent, leaving a coating on the surface with a temperature low enough for a person with gloves to handle.

Common methods in use today for preparing these surfaces include abrasive techniques (e.g., sanding and grit blasting), chemical surface treatments, anodization, and etches prior to primer application. These techniques provide fresh surfaces for bonding that are free from contamination, but these techniques have disadvantages such as the following: hazardous material usage, time-consuming processes, required control of debris/residual contamination, and limited high-temperature product success.  Automated energetic techniques have shown some preliminary success as alternatives to abrasive deoxidation methods in surface preparation processes, but work is needed to develop and demonstrate rapid, robust processes for structural adhesive bonding of titanium surfaces, including large areas on aircraft, in both Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and field environments.\n \nThe dual-use commercialization potential exists. As mentioned previously, the military application is apparent in the increased use of titanium bonding in aircraft for weight reduction and cost savings. Other potential applications include ground vehicles. The technology can be used in OEM as well as depot/overhaul operations.  In addition, the commercial aircraft industry is very interested in improved structural bonding techniques, as are other industries that use advanced bonding of titanium.\n\nDuring Phase I, a technology transition plan should be developed along with an initial business case analysis. In Phase II, these documents should be updated and refined with additional data.",

NDE defect sensitivity objective/threshold of 0.1/0.25 in. diameter.\n\nAir Force-relevant applications include, but are not limited to nondestructive evaluation/inspection (NDE/I) of organic matrix composite (OMC) materials used in leading edges, chines that enable manned or unmanned air systems or airfoils used in gas turbine engines.  Currently all OMC components are inspected by NDE for defects before service and frequently during service as well.  Available NDE techniques and data analyses are very capable of detecting defects in flat plate geometries. However, these methods and analysis tools have difficulty inspecting across the apex of curved parts like leading edges and airfoils while maintaining the required sensitivity to defects.  Incremental improvements to current methods are not being sought.  The intent of this solicitation is to address a very complex inspection requirement that has not been resolved by incremental engineering of the standard five methods (ultrasound, eddy current, radiography, magnetic particle and fluorescent penetrant).  However, it is possible that the potential solution could be based on these methods. Measurements will occur in a variety of temperature and loading conditions on the structure or component when the measurement is performed. This means that the effect of temperature and/or load on the reproducibility and accuracy of the inspection capability must be addressed. Methods that use a baseline comparison (or subtraction) are not being sought. Method must be able to inspect through the thickness of the radii. Defects of interest include delaminations (real not simulated), foreign objects (e.g., backing paper, gloves or sticky notes), porosity, ply related defects (ply gaps, ply laps and ply wrinkles), and bridging.  Bridging is defined as when the outer radius (OR) plies and inner radius (IR) plies separate from each other during processing, creating a void or cavity between them running along the edge).  To further complicate the inspection space some of these components have additional filler materials, such as co-cured or pre-cured OMC \u2018noodles\u2019, which are placed between the OR plies and the IR plies to enable the OR to have a smaller radius than the IR. Components may have varying thickness values and other geometric features in addition to the complex curvature. It is expected that an NDE technique and the associated data analysis will need to be optimized and tailored to enable a single-sided (OR) inspection.  The technique and analysis should not be so specific to the target application that it cannot be easily used on similar parts (different material, layup or radii) with minimal changes to the technique and the analysis.",

As space and air vehicles become more complex with increased power and data requirements, cable harnessing represents a significant portion of overall vehicle weight.  Furthermore, by exploring new opportunities to use nanotechnology on military space platforms, the domestic industrial base for this technology can be strengthened.  As the military technology development for CNT-based wires continues, it is expected that commercial aerospace applications for this technology will become more compelling, further driving down the cost of CNT material.\n\nBy replacing primary copper conductors with CNT-based conductors in electrical cabling, significant weight savings can be realized. This reduced weight saves a considerable amount in launch costs for spacecraft and fuel efficiency for aircraft.  Furthermore, due to the inherent flexure tolerance and environmental stability of CNT materials, CNT-based wires can provide added resilience in the face of natural or man-made electro magnetic interference (EMI) events.\n\nWhile considerable research has been done into the development of low-speed data rate cables, an opportunity exists to increase the conductivity of CNT yarn and tape materials to implement high-speed data transmission CNT cables.  Current development efforts have focused on the \u201clow hanging fruit\u201d of low-speed 1553 and twin-ax cables, but with further research into conductivity optimization, CNT-based wires could feasibly replace all copper data cabling on air and spacecraft.\n\nThis proposal seeks innovative doping and post-processing strategies for increasing the conductivity of CNT-based wires to implement reliable data transfer above the 1 MHz threshold- the current practical limit of existing technologies.  A main objective of this project is to develop a process control and manufacturing strategy for expanding the scale of current research efforts, which have demonstrated promising conductivity results in a laboratory setting.  Proposed technical solution should align with a domestic high-volume manufacturing source of CNT material, or demonstrate the rapid transfer feasibility to a large scale manufacturer.\n\nThe end goal of this technology is a CNT-based finished cable assembly that could serve as a drop-in replacement of existing copper-based high speed data cables. \n\nThe threshold attenuation numbers for the delivered cables should be less than 1.5 dB/100ft at 1 MHz (per Mil Std 1553).

            "description": "The Air Force has multiple critical airborne and space-based applications requiring infrared detection systems with lower cost, size, weight, and power, increased resolution, larger formats, increased reliability, and improved sustainability. The III-V infrared superlattice materials hold promise to significantly lower the cost of existing infrared detection systems due to their advantages over present detectors comprised of bulk materials. These advantages, including less cooling required due to higher operating temperatures, increased manufacturability from leveraging domestic III-V foundries, and increased yield resulting from more uniform deposition on larger substrates, all translate into lower cost while maintaining or increasing performance. Although significant improvements over the last 20-30 years in III-V superlattice material growth, surface passivation, and detector fabrication have created the current state-of-the-art detectors (e.g., high operating temperature at about 150 K, mid-wavelength infrared focal plane array detectors), the remaining elusive materials defects are limiting the operating temperature from reaching 200 K. These defects are possibly point defects native to the materials, or they may be due to crystal defects, such as threading dislocations, resulting in dangling bonds within the material bulk. Such defects can act as deep level trap states, generation centers, or shallow level defect states that decrease the material minority carrier lifetime and Hall mobility and increase the detector dark current while lowering the quantum efficiency. By applying appropriate defect mitigation processes, the number of active defect states can be reduced, thereby improving the material properties necessary to optimize the detector performance for higher operating temperatures. Processes such as post-growth annealing and hydrogenation may improve the material minority carrier lifetime and mobility and thus the detector dark current and quantum efficiency, indicating promise to deactivate material defects behaving as scattering and recombination centers or as deep level traps. A variety of innovative post-growth process techniques may be proposed to address defect mitigation in infrared InAs/InGaSb and InAs/InAsSb superlattice materials and detectors.\n\nThe goal of this program is to systematically explore and develop post-growth defect mitigation processes that can improve the III-V infrared superlattice minority carrier lifetime by at least 10X, Hall mobility by 5-10X, and/or detector dark current by at least 10X at temperatures from 77 K to 200 K. These processes must be thermally compatible with arsenide-antimonide materials and not cause contamination or degradation of the superlattice materials. The stability of the defect mitigation processes must be assessed over time for at least six months and over temperature for at least 20 cycles from 77 K to 300 K.\n\nThe potential for future commercialization of these defect mitigation processes exists to improve device performance not only of III-V superlattice infrared detectors but also emitters (laser diodes, light emitting diodes) and multi-junction solar cells.  Military applications, including Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance as well as Space Situational Awareness, would benefit from the use of these improved high-performance infrared detectors for imaging and characterizing objects of different temperatures.  Commercial applications of these high performance detectors include night-vision cameras, fire detectors, radiation thermometers, satellite-based and medical diagnostic imaging.

Electro-optic modulators are critical devices within high bandwidth analog optical systems, such as the photonic links connecting remote antenna stations on an aircraft to central processors.  It is widely acknowledged that electro-optic modulators are key components with regard to increasing performance of electronic warfare receivers or other analog applications onboard aircraft. While optical processing is one of the strengths offered by rf photonic technology, it can be limited by the ability to process optical materials with high quality and precision for insertion into devices. Here we seek to develop processing of nonlinear optical materials for the purposes of extending the capabilities of an important device for rf photonics, the electro-optic modulator.\n\nPrevious efforts on optically engineered electro-optic modulators have targeted increasing sensitivity through slow light effects or resonant cavities.These modulators are for example created by fabricating photonic crystals, Bragg gratings, or ring cavities within the modulator. There are also results that have used post modulation optical filtering to achieve more linear responses, however they are fundamentally limited since it is not possible to post filter the third-order or second-order distortions that are already within the passband. It is therefore desirable to develop high quality nanostructured materials for the purpose of both linearization and increasing the sensitivity of electro-optic modulators. There is a fundamental difference between optical filtering of the modulated light after it exits the modulator, and having the modulator itself be comprised of a nanostructured material since the nonlinear mixing process is changed by that latter but not the former.\n\nThis solicitation is not targeting slow light enhancements, the goal is controlled in-situ optical filtering within traveling wave modulators. Therefore useful optical responses must be well controlled and be able to filter down to the 5GHz range if possible, with the sharper filtering effect being better. For instance, a Lithium Niobate modulator that is also has an optical passband including only the optical fundamental minus 50 GHz is a useful configuration. It should also be noted that the filtering may alter the light wave velocity and therefore the traveling wave configuration of the rf electrodes will likely have to be engineered to match. For this effort, the optical fundamental wavelength is 1.55 microns, meaning that fabrication will need approximately 300-400nm feature sizes to be able to replicate modeled designs. Feature sidewall roughness, lattice uniformity, and depth will be critical factors since losses must be strictly controlled for useful materials.",

Such approaches entail the creation, manipulation, and storage of spatially varying process related data that is atypical of traditional cast or wrought component design and fabrication. Such data includes but is not limited to location specific process parameter values, material property target values, scan paths, process data collected during the fabrication process, and post build material characterization outputs.  Such data is useful for a range of activities including process design and evaluation, AM process model calibration and validation, and possibly qualification.\n\nThere are many existing Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools with capabilities for geometry definition, manipulation, and evaluation. While some attempts have been made to integrate AM workflows into existing CAD paradigms [1], in general existing CAD tools are not AM \"process aware\" and do not have the capability to manage the necessary spatially varying process data. The Additive Manufacturing Format (AMF) recently defined by ASTM [2] provides more advanced capabilities than the traditional STL format, but is primarily focused on geometry definition and has limited support for spatially varying process data. Equipment specific proprietary AM process planning software is employed to specify process parameters and to create scan paths based on geometry input from a CAD file (often in the STL format). This processing information is passed directly to the AM hardware, and is not typically available to designers or engineers for process optimization and qualification efforts.\n\nA framework that bridges the gap between existing CAD tools and proprietary AM planning software by managing all of the data associated with both the geometry and process itself could mitigate this problem. Such a framework would interface with conventional tools used to define the geometry as well as those for planning the AM process. It should provide capabilities to store and manipulate spatially varying process data generated as part of both the design and fabrication process. Additionally such a tool would allow for interfaces to third party process monitoring equipment, post process inspection and characterization tools, or even process modeling and optimization software.\n\nA potential challenge is that the AM process data in question can be both specific to a particular AM machine as well as proprietary in nature. Possible approaches to mitigate this issue include strategically working with AM equipment hardware manufacturers, or the development of an application programming interface (API) that proprietary software could interact with directly.",

This topic focuses specifically on the development of hardware capable of handling and codepositing polymeric, metallic, and ceramic materials on any given substrate (polymer, metal, ceramic) to create a hybridized structure.  To research and development, machine deposition capabilities need to be highly variable beyond expected production envelopes.  The ability to modify the composition of any single material class may be required to accomplish hybridization.  Such capability is of extreme interest.

The greater strength-to-weight ratio of CMCs compared to metals also allows designers to reduce weight, which in turn contributes to fuel burn savings.  Machining CMC materials, however, is a complex task due to their heterogeneous nature.  In addition, CMCs are easily damaged unless machining is performed properly. Finally, by the time the CMC component is ready for machining, the part has considerable value and the cost of scrapping is unacceptably high. Thus, the cost, difficulty, value and impact of that machining are high.\n\nMultiple machining modeling software tools are currently available to simulate and optimize conventional machining processes for metal components.

To maintain instrument sensitivity, the filters must exhibit high transmission (70 percent or higher) and operate properly with imaging systems on the order of f/3 as a threshold requirement, and with the objective f/1. Concepts supporting direct deposition of filters on FPA, or even inserting the narrowband filtering in the detector response, are of interest; however, the baseline concept is for a patterned filter on an infrared-transmitting substrate that can be mounted directly in front of a cryogenically-cooled (40-65 K) infrared FPA.\n\nThere will be no need for government materials, equipment, data, or facilities in the initial phase of this research.",

Our most current kinetic weapon systems were not designed for considering the cyber security threat, and resilience thereof. Current information assurance (IA) and safety certifications focus on operational ranges and known fault conditions, but no effort is made to counter the intelligent cyber attacks that have been executed in the past or anticipate possible threats by a sophisticated and well-resourced adversary. Each airframe contains numerous electronic line replaceable units (LRUs) that are connected to other LRUs and avionics subsystems. These weapons system components should be secure when delivered, however they are susceptible to cyber attacks because of substandard coding methods which include the lack of software vulnerability scanning and correction at the engineering level. Adversaries can exploit these vulnerabilities within the systems via various connection points during maintenance operations, and other software/hardware/firmware updates due to mission requirements.\n\nCurrent processes to identify system vulnerabilities are ad-hoc, and labor intensive, they require specialized knowledge to identify and assess likely attack vectors. Additionally, methods for conducting an operational impact analysis have not been developed or matured to determine how these weaknesses impact the mission. This methodology and supporting tools are required to analyze both the logical and physical avionics architecture and use this information to drive a protection solution. This methodology must consider and identify how the subsystems are interconnected as well as access points to those systems through which support elements (e.g., maintenance aids, data loaders) are connected. Lastly the process must support identification of the possible exploitation of the systems and connection points and determine the operational impact to the weapon system; with this data a risk management process can define controls and countermeasures to limit or eliminate the threat. The overall goal for this effort is to mitigate vulnerabilities through access points by 80 percent through authentication, input validation, and employ protection techniques while reducing security susceptibilities by 80 percent associated with mission planning, maintenance, loader, and test equipment, etc.",

            "description": "Synthetic Aperture LADAR (SAL) is an imaging sensor technique that provides long-range optical images using the time of flight measurement from the platform and tracking the phase of the return signal over time to produce a synthetic image. SAL operates according to the same principles as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), enabling the capture of images with a synthetic aperture much larger than the physical aperture, and resulting in high resolution images at longer ranges than possible with a physical aperture. Compared to SAR, SAL operates at wavelengths less than 1/1000 that of SAR, providing much higher resolution and can provide images with the fidelity needed for target identification. Because SAL operates at wavelengths similar to visible wavelengths, images from a SAL system are readily interpretable by humans without training.\n\nNon-mechanical beam steering (NMBS) is a technology that provides the ability to direct a laser beam without physical movement of the optical elements. Although NMBS techniques have been demonstrated to steer optical imagery for conventional focal plane imagery, NMBS has not been shown to operate with a SAL system. NMBS offers similar advantages to a SAL sensor as it does to direct detection ladar, such as reduced weight, random access to steering directions, and expanded field of view. Due to long ranges and the correspondingly long time of flight, there is the potential for SAL systems to handle multiple look directions simultaneously. In addition, because of the long ranges that SAL is expected to operate at, the ability of NMBS to provide high speed beam stabilization is an additional benefit that could be realized.\n \nTo date, the most effective NMBS systems operate using liquid crystal devices to modify the phase of the beam to steer the beam. While in direct detection ladar systems, the phase changes are not a significant concern, in a coherent ladar, such as SAL, the effect of the NMBS system on the phase is critically important. To date current NMBS devices have not demonstrated compatibility with coherent ladar systems. \n\nCommercial application of a NMBS with SAL sensors would provide similar benefits to military systems.\n\nThe goal of this effort is to demonstrate a NMBS technology that is compatible with a SAL sensor, which could be used in a target pod to support long range target identification. The NMBS should show capability to steer a SAL system with minimal impact to performance. The primary SAL wavelength of interest is 1.5 micron, however operations from 1 to 2 microns can be considered. The steering system should be capable of scaling to 15 cm apertures. The steering system should be capable of steering 45 degrees off-boresight. Continuous steering is preferred, but not required. In the case of a step steering system, the steering increments should be no more than 1 degree. Steering efficiency is important and should be greater than 80 percent (power out/power in). Switching speeds should be greater than 1 kHz. The overall system should demonstrate compatibility with a SAL system with steering on both the receive and transmitter paths because phase noise on the transmitter could directly translate to phase noise on receive. The technology demonstrated must show traceability to a pod environment, power < 100 Watts, weight < 5 kg, and < 4 L of volume.    \n\nGovernment materials, equipment, data or facilities are not necessary.",

GIISR will provide battlefield information to the warfighter at any weather condition in real-time.  Experts believe unauthorized users can hold our intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets at risk and force us to operate at sub-optimal standoffs.  Further, inexpensive electronic attack systems can limit our ability to collect reliable ISR from mono-static platforms.  Hence, to address these onerous technical challenges for contested/anti-access area denial (A2AD) environment, the Air Force must develop affordable, low-cost ISR systems with advanced exploitation capabilities.  In general, future ISR systems must be designed so that unauthorized users cannot penetrate to downgrade our ISR capabilities at any critical chain (transmit, receive, and processing) of operation.  Our transmit signals must be designed in such a way that an enemy cannot see our presence.\n\nRecently, researchers have developed theoretical foundation for spread spectrum coded linear frequency modulation (LFM) transmit signal that has potentials for solving some of the above mentioned technical challenges of the contested environment [1-2].  Some of the characteristics of these signals are: (a) inherit properties of direct sequence spread spectrum and LFM waveforms, (b) remain almost orthogonal on both transmit and receive, and (c) can hide while operating in adversaries environments.  In addition, when properly processed, two important benefits of these signals are: (a) can provide exploitation capabilities that LFM waveforms exhibit (i.e., Doppler tolerant) and (b) can achieve high resolution imaging capability to separate a weak target that is close to a strong target. Other approaches on waveforms design and exploitations can be found in various literatures [3-5].\n\nWe are seeking sensor technology development to accomplish both (1) transmit signal design and (2) exploitation algorithms for simultaneous SAR and GMTI processing. This technology should advance the state-of-the-art and be effective in the A2AD environment; in particular, our signal should not be corrupted by the other users so as to reduce the effectiveness of the surveillance systems.  Operating environment to be focused on is contested region but not limited to other scenarios.  Performance measures to include are improved signal to clutter and noise ratio, ultra high resolution to discern a weak target close to a strong target, and shorter time for both SAR and GMTI exploitation.\n\nThe emphasis of this research will be developing waveforms and exploitation algorithms for affordable ISR systems to provide tactical edge in the A2AD/contested environment.  We are interested in experimenting proposed waveforms (in hardware) and using these to develop joint SAR and GMTI exploitation algorithms.  If implemented successfully, the key benefits to the warfighters will be: (1) transmit signals can hide in adversaries environment but enable ISR objectives and (2) solve the joint SAR and GMTI problem without complexities associated with reconfiguring the radar systems for SAR or GMTI mode. Teaming with a prime contractor is encouraged. No government funded equipment or data will be provided.

            "description": "Ground moving target indication (GMTI) processing is a critical technology for persistent, all-weather global integrated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (GIISR). GMTI processing includes detection, geolocation, and tracking of multiple moving and stationary targets. In recent years, SAR has been used in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms due to all-weather exploitation, video SAR formation, and long-range coverage. Unlike conventional radar, SAR can provide video of the interrogated scene and detection and tracking capabilities. In addition, using a SAR system, a target could be detected without a minimum detectable velocity (i.e., detection of move-stop-move target). Furthermore, SAR-GMTI processing can be accomplished using a single phase center/single channel. However, multiple moving targets detection, geolocation, tracking, in complex environment is a challenging problem. This is due to the fact that moving targets' signature Doppler shift and smear because of velocity of the targets and radar. Moreover, noise of the operating environments and clutter sources add complexity to detect and track targets. Hence, the goal of this research is to develop a unified theory for multiple moving targets detection, geolocation, and tracking in complex, heterogeneous clutter environments.\n\nResearchers developed theories and algorithms to address the GMTI processing [1-5]. Among different techniques, scientists developed a strategy to focus the energy of a moving target so that it could be detected and tracked. However, geolocation problems are left unresolved or operating environments with multiple targets or weak targets (i.e., low radar cross section targets) have not been considered for these solutions. Some researchers have implemented \u201cad hoc\u201d techniques (i.e., GMTI algorithms) for target detection and tracking that work on some specific data set only.\n\nThe emphasis of this research will be fundamental understanding of moving target phenomenology under SAR and incorporating those findings for GMTI algorithm development. First, research needs to be conducted to fully understand the parameters that influence defocussing/smearing of moving targets\u2019 signature. Second, we have to investigate the influence of noise and clutter on multiple moving targets detection, geolocation, and tracking. Third, we have to examine waveforms\u2019 role for targets detection. Fourth, we need to evaluate different tracking algorithms and select the one that will perform the best for a given operating environment. Fifth, we may need to incorporate prior information of the interrogated scene for geolocation accuracy. Computational costs associated with real-time execution of the proposed algorithms should be fully analyzed. The ability to integrate these areas into a unified systems theory prototype to allow system trade studies may also be needed. By addressing the above mentioned technical barriers and developing a system trade space analysis capability, we may reach a comprehensive solution and unified theory for GMTI processing that is vital for improving performance of modern persistent ISR systems. We are interested in experimenting proposed algorithms to various radar operating environments that include air-to-ground or space-to-ground. Frequency parameters for radar could be ranging from UHF to Ka band. For air-to-ground operation, 45 degree elevation angle will be considered.

The objective is to develop and implement methods that allow for the utilization of the open-signal GNSS signals to generate Position Navigation and Timing (PNT) with improved integrity, authentication and availability compared to commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) GNSS offerings. When integrated with MGUE, this must occur without compromising the current security and information assurance of MGUE [1].\n\nAn example of a system concept for processing the GNSS signals with MGUE could be to use a \u201cGNSS Engine\u201d that could be \u201cbolted-on\u201d to the \u201cMGUE Engine\u201d on a host application system. The host system using an external application processor would blend the same observables from both engines to produce a resilient GNSS and MGUE PNT solution.\n\nIn recent years, interest has grown in developing useful anti-spoof techniques for non-military use. Researchers in the United States and abroad have conducted research in this area, yielding a significant amount of open source literature on the topic. Examples of suitable techniques include signal power monitoring, reasonability checks, Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) techniques, statistical evaluation, and direction of arrival measurements. Techniques should be evaluated in terms of complexity, processing requirements, additional hardware (HW) (e.g., multi-element arrays) required, ease of modification, suitability for different applications (e.g., smartphone or avionics receiver), and effectiveness against different types of attacks.\n\nThe goals for such a hybrid MGUE-GNSS system would be dependent upon the representative military host platform capability; however the following suggestions should guide the development effort:\n1. Projected power consumption increase due to resiliency functionality is less than 10 percent over the baseline MGUE capability.\n2. Size and weight impact to the host application system does not adversely impact the user or drive integration costs.\na. For handheld PNT systems, size and weight increase is kept below 15 percent of the baseline.\nb. For munitions and aviation platforms, size should be constrained to form factors of existing line replaceable units and increased weight should not adversely affect the center of gravity of the platform.\nc. Antenna requirements should take into account existing antenna mounting, depth and siting locations for the host platform to minimize integration cost.\n3. Impacts to user tactics, techniques and procedures must be clearly identified.\n4.

Current Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) techniques rely on relatively large, vacuum-isolated optical reference cavities for frequency stabilization.  These reference cavities and their associated vibration and acoustic isolation systems currently range in size from 0.5 to 1.5 cubic feet.  Although effective, these cavities are difficult to package and stabilize in highly dynamic flight environments.  Methods to miniaturize master oscillator configurations will be investigated with a goal to achieve an \"integrated circuit-scale\u201d system.  These methods may include novel approaches to miniaturize current PDH techniques as well as entirely new stabilization approaches that can provide the required stabilization performance and yield size, weight, and power (SWAP) reductions.  This technology could be applied to multiple coherent ladar systems including synthetic aperture imaging, remote vibrometry, holographic imaging as well as radar, navigation, and timing.  The listed coherent ladar capabilities have broad interest and use within the Air Force for combat identification applications; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance needs; and targeting applications in air-to-air and air-to-ground scenarios.\n\nTo further spell out the requirements for this master oscillator, preferred methods will be applicable across wavelengths ranging from 1.5 microns to 2 microns; however, point designs at 2.0 microns, which has the highest priority, or 1.5 microns are acceptable.  The threshold requirement for maintaining wavelength stability is +/- 50 MHz of the nominal operating wavelength.  The master oscillator\u2019s line width has a threshold requirement of 100 Hz and an objective of 10 Hz.  The desired output power of the master oscillator is 20 mW.  To provide some scope to the afore mentioned \"highly dynamic flight environment\", a desired operating environment (in terms of operating temperatures, motion, and vibration) would be a pod-based system.  The flight envelope for a pod would include temperatures ranging from -20 to 50 degrees C; however, the pod internal environment is controlled to operate in a much tighter temperature range (e.g., 20 to 35 degrees C).  Pods can operate over Mach 1 and experience up to 9g.  When considering SWAP, proposed approaches will need to consider the kinds of constraints inherent to pod-based systems.  To provide a point of comparison, LRU components for pod-based systems have sizes and weights that are on the order of 0.5 cubic feet and 20 pounds, respectively.  Relative to these values, a significant reduction in SWAP is desired such that 0.1 cubic feet would be a threshold size for a complete system, including any vibration and acoustic isolation systems should the proposed approaches require them.",

However, because of the assumption of statistical independence, this commonly used model cannot be applied for analysis of long-range propagation effects associated with large-scale coherent ionospheric and atmospheric structures with long correlation lengths.  For the same reason, the conventional thin 2D phase screen approach does not permit analysis of RF and optical systems whose performance depends on the spatial correlation properties of ray path difference (piston phase) along the propagation path [3].  Among these systems for example are Next Generation Over The Horizon (NGOTH) radars and coherent imaging ladars.  With an anticipated long operational range there is a growing need in novel physics based analytical and numerical techniques specifically designed to address challenges of long-range communications through the media with developed large scale coherent structures [4].  Proposed research effort should initiate the development of new 3D ionospheric and atmospheric propagation models with incorporated physics based models of coherent and random field density irregularities with at least one and up to two orders of magnitude potential performance improvement in resolution.  Applicants should develop ionospheric and atmospheric physics based models for generation of 3D coherent and random large scale density irregularities with long-range spatial correlation properties. Performance parameters for such models should be able to cover the wide range of spatial scales from several kilometers to several centimeters.

These sources are suitable for many DoD applications such as infrared countermeasures (IRCM) and active laser sensing, specifically for airborne systems, due to size, weight, and power (SWAP) considerations. However, the VECSEL platform is less robust compared with most semiconductor lasers due to alignment-sensitive curved external optics. Replacing the external optics with diffractive optical elements (DOE) that may be bonded directly to the semiconductor will increase the robustness of the system, as well as stabilize the wavelength. The DOE approach may potentially be used with any other types of the lasers, not necessarily VECSELs. To date, however, efficient structures have typically utilized flat (non-curved) interferograms. Currently there are technologies available that may allow holographic recording of volume DOE structures in bulk optical materials, for example, DOE in photo-thermo-refractive glass (PTRG), or another example, 3-D surface etched gratings.\n\nThe goal of this research is to develop innovative DOE structures with low optical loss (less than 1 percent), high reflectivity (more than 96%), operating at high optical powers (100 W or more) at the wavelength around 1000 nm (design wavelength is TBD), transparent to the pump wavelength at around 808 nm, and suitable to replace concave mirrors used as an external laser cavity.

This structural damage often occurs in deep, complex, multi-layered structures, buried underneath other aircraft components, and is generally very difficult to access.  However, regular inspections are required for any safety critical damage; as a result, aircraft mechanics may spend several days removing \u2013 and afterwards securing and reassembling - structures to gain access to an area for a nondestructive inspection that might only take less than 30 minutes to perform.  This access time is a serious impact to the flow days of programmed depot maintenance and increases the risk of maintenance induced damage.  Thus, a strong demand for new NDI technologies exists to perform reliably inspections of deep, hidden crack or corrosion flaws in a depot aircraft maintenance environment.\n\nAir Force maintenance, including NDI procedures, are being enhanced to meet the requirements laid out by the Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP) based on a damage tolerance approach.  As a result, the requirements for research, development and application of new NDI initiatives has to significantly improve overall NDI capabilities, not only reduce the burden of time and cost intensive inspection, but also to ensure the reliability of the inspection results and, to increase the safety of continuous operation for the aging Air Force aircraft fleets. As stated, improving flaw detection beyond the first layer in multi-layered, complex, and difficult to access structures is a highly critical inspection need. Approaching this problem, however, requires a comprehensive understanding of its daunting complexity. To illustrate this complexity, a list of factors affecting NDI for cracks in a two-layered strcutre was generated [1]. These factors were categorized as being originated by the 1) employed NDI method, for instance, the coupling conditions between a contact ultrasonic transducer and the test piece surface, 2) part geometry, material and condition, including complexity of layered-structure, presence of sealant material between layers, previous repair situation, etc., and 3) flaw characteristics, including flaw number, type, size, location, etc. Understanding of the factors and their respective separate and synergetic influences on both the potential to implement a new approach and the resulting measurement data is essential.\n\nWithin the scope of this effort, new and innovative NDI technology will be developed demonstrating reliability and feasibility to inspect deep flaws in complex, multi-layered structures. No limitations regarding the NDI technology are given; however, a successful capability demonstration will require a thorough inclusion of all structural boundary conditions and specific inspection conditions. The emphasis is on deep flaw detection development in metallic structures, thus, candidate NDI solutions will concentrate on corrosion and/or crack detection applications.",

For Air Force landing-gear systems, CuBe in the highest strength condition is the choice when excessive wear from field service underscores a need for greater wear resistance than standard Al-Bronze or Ni-Al-Bronze bushings. However, because of the toxic constituent Be, the eventual removal of CuBe bushings from DoD weapon systems appears likely. A potential toxic health hazard exists from wear debris generated in-service, which then results in uncontrolled exposure to maintenance personnel.  Beryllium is a Category I carcinogen, and fine particulate inhalation of Be can result in beryliosis.\n\nThis effort is to research and qualify substitutes for CuBe material in high load landing gear applications, primarily on F-16 (about 3\" outside diameter max) but also on C-5 (about 5\" diameter max). Mechanical property objectives include ultimate tensile strength within 12 percent of CuBe and elongation of under 3 percent; desired friction wear is no more than .9  percent diametral wear depth (threshold) with an objective goal of .5 percent diametral wear.

This method does not include any prognostic capability into the scheduling that may assist in reducing the amount of re-planning necessary. Currently, there is no means to assist the scheduler in dynamically re-planning that also includes the aircraft detail.\n\nThe current method relies heavily on human-in-the-loop to perform scheduling so that when an unplanned event occurs it becomes a labor intensive operation to analyze and re-plan the schedule leading to delays. A new paradigm is needed to move the current re-planning effort from a static level process to a dynamic level process that incorporates aircraft prognostics [2]. The new human-on-the-loop process becomes executive monitoring to verify the updated schedules are easible and can be adjusted as needed.\n\nThe new paradigm will require the incorporation of powerful mathematical and algorithmic tools. Data mining and fusion are needed to identify the critical information needed to make intelligent decisions. Information reasoning will be needed to predict future bottlenecks and dynamically react to them. The master scheduler will benefit from being able to maximize depot throughput while maintaining work requirements in a dynamic environment.",

These failures have resulted in aircraft damage (low tire pressures may have resulted in the loss of a weapon system or life).  Maintenance crews are tasked with frequently measuring tire pressures and servicing tires to maintain the required aviation tire pressures. These maintenance procedures add additional risk to the maintenance of aircraft.  Tire failures can often be attributed to lapses in maintenance.  Low tire pressure also reduces tire life which increases operational costs.  A quick visual check of a tire pressure indicator prior to launching an aircraft would reduce the risk of possible damage and reduce cost of flying.\n\nThe Air Force is interested in developing a simple, reliable, cost effective device that will visually indicate the tire pressure.  The indicator shall be visible and distinguishable from at least 10 feet for unaided eyes.  The indicator shall constantly display the tire pressure.  The device shall have at least two indication methods: proper inflation and incorrect inflation.  The device indication methods shall be easily customized to match the required tire pressures for the given aircraft / sortie.  Accuracy of the device shall match the accuracy currently required for manual tire pressure gauges.  The device shall be highly reliable, but shall be fail safe in that it will not indicate proper inflation if the device has malfunctioned.  Although it is expected that the device will be larger than the current valve stem and/or cap, the size of the device shall be such that it will not interfere with any other surface.  The device shall not interfere with any other aircraft function.  The device will allow tire servicing and traditional pressure checks using current Air Force tooling.  The design shall be able to survive military aircraft usage environments including, but not limited to, factors such as: durability, shock resistance, vibration, heat, cold, ice, salt spray, water, air flow, debris, G-loading, etc.  It shall not create a foreign object debris, or FOD, hazard.  There shall be no risk of loss of air pressure due to the device.  The device must be able to satisfy all applicable air worthiness requirements.\n\nPast efforts have been made to simplify the manner at which tire pressures are measured.  To date, no cost effective solutions have become available.  The current valve stem assembly is approximately $10 dollars.  To successfully accomplish a business case analysis (BCA), the device shall have a minimal increase in cost. The large quantity of aircraft wheels in the Air Force fleet will make any solution that is cost prohibitive nearly impossible to implement.\n\nNo Government equipment or facilities will be provided for this research and development effort.

Currently, heat flux measurements are typically performed at discrete points using small-diameter Schmidt-Boelter heat flux gages that are difficult to install within a model and often damaged at prolonged exposure to high temperatures. Two test facilities at the Arnold Engineering Development Complex, Tenn., with this need are Tunnel B, with a stagnation temperature range from 416 to 750 K and a stagnation pressure range from 40 to 900 psi, and Tunnel C, with a stagnation temperature range from 933 to 1200 K and a stagnation pressure range from 200 to 2000 psi. Noncontact, optical-based techniques that provide continuous, \u201cglobal\u201d measurements over the entire model surface are needed to obtain comprehensive data and greatly improve testing efficiency.  Optical methods could be used to measure heat flux directly or measurement of surface temperature, from which heat flux data could be determined using numerical modeling of the test model\u2019s internal heating.  The optical methods could be based on characteristics of the model surface, such as its infrared emission or changes in emissivity (e.g., direct, multispectral, or hyperspectral thermal imaging). Methods requiring application of coatings to the test model, such as temperature sensitive paint, thermographic phosphors, or high emissivity paint, will be considered, but must easily applied and easily removed to avoid permanent alteration of the test model. Also, coatings must not substantially alter the aerodynamic characteristics of the model surface, such as surface roughness, and the model \u201cmold lines.\u201d Vapor deposition and plasma spray methods for these coating applications will not be acceptable. A minimum temperature measurement resolution of 0.5 K is needed and a temperature rise of 20 K over 2 minutes is to be expected. A 1 x 1 mm spatial resolution is desired, but 5 x 5 mm will be minimally acceptable. Phase I should provide a preliminary optical-based system design describing the precision and accuracy along with a technical trade study for test facility implementation. Principal components of the design concept should be demonstrated for minimum spatial and temperature resolution.

Ground testing is a critical test and evaluation requirement for the calibration and characterization of next generation airborne and space-borne imaging systems for field reliability and cost-effectiveness. This testing requires extremely uniform radiometric sources to provide simulated intensity over the full field of view (FOV) of a sensor under test (SUT). Typically, a flat plate is prepared with a high-emissivity surface and instrumented with heaters and temperature sensors to provide spatially uniform emissivity and temperature.  The surface may be specially prepared such that narcissus is reduced and that the output is uniform over a range of viewing angles.  Temperatures up to 400 K can be achieved but generates tremendous heat in the chamber causing significant radiometric and cooling issues.  A uniform illumination source is desired that has an effective aperture greater than 27 cm, an effective spectral emissivity greater than 0.9995 from 2 to 30 \u00b5m in wavelength and provides a temperature sensor-based Planckian radiance with a radiance temperature uncertainty of less than 25 mK over a 200 to 400 K temperature range. The radiance accuracy must be maintained over the entire aperture and within a full solid angle defined by an 8-degree cone angle. The entire device must fit into a cylindrical volume that is less than 30 cm diameter and less than 10.16 cm in height. The target total heat load must be no greater than half the heat load that a 27 cm diameter aperture-cavity type blackbody would radiate out the front for any given temperature.  The device must survive in the cryovacuum environment and not produce or be susceptible to cryo-contamination.  Extension of these concepts to visible sources would be a stretch goal. Phase I should demonstrate (including a calibrated radiance measurement) a prototype uniform-illumination source that produces Planckian radiation equivalent to blackbody radiation (200 to 400 K) over a surface diameter of 15.24 cm and an angular extent of 4 degrees.

            "description": "Infrared signature measurement is a process of collecting calibrated infrared images of a target.  Calibration refers to the fact that the image is not simply a greyscale infrared image: each pixel in the infrared image will have a radiance value. The \u201ctarget\u201d will typically be a threat target, such as a T-72 tank. \n\nThe signature measurement process has three key requirements:\n1. Target measurements are conducted at a fixed location(s). In rare instances customers require measurements to occur at remote locations.\n2. Measurements are taken in sets of images throughout a day. Measurements must occur before and after sunrise and sunset, as well as other times to accurately characterize a target.\n3. The images of a target must be collected at multiple specific cardinal points for each set, at a constant range for each point. These cardinal points are defined by specific aspect and depression angles, specified by a customer of the data. A typical set of aspect angles will be 45, 135, 225, and 315 degrees, with each aspect angle being measured at depression angles of 0, 30, and 60 degrees. The range to the target must be sufficient so that the infrared cameras can view the entire target in a single frame, and the range must be constant: it must be the same range for each measurement.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that each  measurement set is calibrated. Calibration sources constitute a separate target. The cameras are interchangeable within the collection system, and are frequently updated as new sensor technology becomes available. Targets can be widely varied in both size and configuration.\n\nThere are two traditional techniques to conduct infrared signature measurement to meet the key requirements above, specifically, the third requirement. \n\nThese methods have shortcomings which are noted below:\n1. The target is placed on a turntable to change the aspect angle, and the sensors are placed on a lift, to adjust the cameras\u2019 depression angle. The turntable method is now an invalid signature measurement technique because the target rotation heats the target evenly, and is not considered operationally realistic.\n2. The current state-of-the-art method is a collapsible tower (with multiple cameras mounted to the top of the tower) attached to an instrumentation van. The instrumentation van drives to the desired aspect angle, and the tower is raised to the desired height to achieve the required depression angle. The sensors collect the data, and the raw data is transmitted via multiple GigE streams to computer systems inside the van. This method has multiple shortcomings:\n(1) The tower must be stowed before the van can be driven. Raising and lowering the tower in this manner significantly slows data collection. \n(2) Available commercial off-the-shelf towers that can be operated safely for the van configuration have a limited height, and this limits the depression angles that can be utilized for target measurement. These shortcomings limit the quality of the signature data.\n\nThe requirement for this SBIR is an innovative new system to improve three metrics: \n(1) The innovative system must increase the speed at which a single set of data can be collected beyond the current state-of-the-art method.\n(2) The innovative system must improve collection versatility by increasing depression angles beyond current state-of-the-art. This will be achieved by increasing the maximum sensor height beyond state-of-the-art.\n(3) The innovative system must increase total system reliability beyond state-of-the-art.",

However, these imaging techniques generally provide only one view of the flow around the test article, and are \u201cline-of-sight\u201d techniques that provide little or no information about feature location along the camera\u2019s viewing direction.  Images from multiple directions are needed to construct three dimensional images. This can be achieved by using several cameras, or probably less favorably, using one camera and changing the orientation of the test article in the tunnel.  Methods for rapidly generating near-real time three-dimensional images from two-dimensional camera images are needed for near-real time testing decisions during wind tunnel testing. Innovative solutions may use, but are not limited to, techniques used in  computer-assisted tomography, where images from multiple directions are transformed into three-dimensional information using Fourier transforms, or by some kind of stereophotogrammetry technique.",

            "description": "High-speed flight of future vehicles is a challenging environment for existing material systems and structures to withstand in acreage applications.  These conditions are often complex, with interacting thermal, mechanical, acoustic, and vibratory loads that stress structures in ways that are complicated to capture in analytical tools.  Detailed understanding of structural behavior in extreme environments, such as that experienced in hypersonic flight, requires a significant improvement in the damage modeling and analysis of high temperature composites (over 1500 degrees F) as they would be used in a structural application.  Current modeling is often limited in scope to linear elastic analysis that fails to capture critical stress locations resulting from localized damage in a material modifying the load path.  In Phase I, a methodology shall be developed for the damage modeling of a ceramic carbon-based or noncarbon-based composite material to examine its behavior as a structural system under thermal, mechanical, and thermo-mechanical loading.  In this context, damage modeling refers to capturing material behavior that is non-linear, in addition to the elastic regime.  Preliminary development of an analytical tool should be completed in Phase I, and verified against an existing material property data set, selected by the proposer.  The tool should be capable of easy integration into commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) finite element analysis software such as ABAQUS, and a user's guide for the tool should be provided.  While material behavior is important to capture in this effort, focus should be on understanding the resulting impact of material behavior on structural response.  The tool should be flexible enough to be implemented in vehicle level analysis without increasing model run-time substantially.  The proposer shall also describe techniques for future validation of the tool using physical experimentation, such as static, cyclic, or other standardized testing.  The offeror must demonstrate an understanding of the required information necessary to build such a tool, as well as anticipate how a high-speed flight environment will require analysis capable of integrating the multi-axial nature of damage in a structural scale analysis.  Phase II efforts should anticipate exercising an appropriate validation and verification process for their tool as described in Phase I, including purchasing of material for testing.\n\nIf successful, the methodology and tool will be valuable to the design and analysis of high-speed structures for future systems by capturing stress concentrations in a vehicle early in the development cycle.  This reduces the risk of a vehicle design having a critical flaw, which may remain unknown until after the failure of a flight test.  The tool could also be applied to other extreme conditions beyond high-speed flight, such as in engine components or aft deck environments.  Appropriate coordination with a vendor of finite element analysis software may be beneficial for future commercial application of the tool.",

Bleeding low momentum (boundary layer) flows represents an approach to enhance the performance of a high speed inlet, especially if the inlet is a fixed-geometry design.  Such enhancement offers potential vehicle range increases of up to 10 percent (for missiles and aircraft) or increased vehicle payload capacity (for aircraft and launch systems).\n\nHigh-speed aeropropulsion integration systems are characterized by high Mach number gas flows through a \u201cflowpath\u201d that can include the vehicle forebody and aftbody surfaces (open compression and expansion) as well as the closed duct that connects the air intake and exhaust elements of the propulsion system components.   The interaction of the high Mach flows with the aircraft and engine structures generates complex fluid dynamic phenomena that include shock waves, shear layers, vortices, and separated flows, all of which can be further influenced by the thermochemical behavior of the high-temperature air.  These fluid phenomena affect high-speed inlet operability and performance, but are not well understood, nor modeled.  As such, inlet development often incorporates parametric testing of active and passive flow control approaches, such as bleed.  Parametric inlet bleed implemented in the region of shock wave-boundary layer interaction (SWBLI) is particularly challenging due to the dynamic nature of the interaction, which can cause flow recirculation through the bleed holes and attendant loss of their effectiveness.  Further, structural limitations can restrict the surface area available for bleed ports and space limitations restrict the volume of the bleed plenum; such restrictions make both the implementation and measurement of bleed flows difficult.\n\nInlet bleed patterns in high-speed wind tunnel models have historically been implemented by selectively filling or opening holes in plates with large arrays of holes.  Dental plaster and high-temperature RTV serve as fill material.  Both of these materials require lengthy cure times and are difficult to apply and remove.  Second, when tunnel blockage requirements allow, bleed flows are manifolded and measured using a mass flow plug that is located at the end of a long pipe.  Often there is not enough tunnel blockage margin to allow use of long bleed pipes and flow plugs.  Third, in-stream dividers are sometimes used in the bleed plenum to mitigate flow recirculation in the region of shock wave-boundary layer interactions.  These devices are limited by the bleed plate area and plenum volume, and mechanical attachment can be challenging.  The state of the art in implementing and parametrically varying bleed flow in the ground testing of high-speed engine inlets severely constrains their development.",

            "description": "Flight through the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds can result in the coupled interaction of thermal response, structural deformation, and aerodynamics, known as fluid-thermal-structural interactions (FTSI). Design of an effective control system will require understanding of the system response to associated uncertainties. Uncertainties can come in the form of unpredictable aerodynamic forces and errors in onboard guidance and navigation sensors. Currently, the multi-disciplinary coupling of aerodynamics, thermal dynamics, structural dynamics, and material sciences are not well understood. This is particularly true of their accumulated impacts when traveling through many flight regimes. The impracticality of conducting ground-based experiments that can address characterization of these issues compounds the problem.     \n\nWhile the aeroelastic and control problems in every flight regime are important, most previous research efforts have had limited consideration. For systems operating at very high altitudes there has been considerable work performed, such as for re-entry and information, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) vehicles. However, there are still many knowledge gaps that warrant further study. In particular, many previous efforts have been restricted to limited operating conditions or to simplistic geometries (i.e., airfoils, panels, etc.). There exists no literature documenting the investigation of aeroelastic and control problems on high speed vehicles operating at terminal flight conditions subjected to the extreme structural and thermal loads experienced at high dynamic pressures. This is a niche that has been unique to the weapons community, whose systems are desired to operate in these extreme environments. This topic is motivated by these knowledge gaps and focuses on reduced-order modeling (ROM) of the relevant multi-physics associated with evolving FTSI effects for deforming high speed structures subjected to extreme environmental conditions, such as those encountered during the high speed terminal portion of weapons engagement. An example would be terminal guidance of an air-breathing airframe, beginning with long duration flight above Mach 5 and diving from above 70 kft to the earth's surface.\n\nThe state-of-the-art in prediction of these influences includes high-fidelity prediction techniques such as finite element and finite difference models that are computationally demanding. Uncoupled, reduced-order models are also available for structural dynamics that reconstruct the forced airframe response from an orthogonal eigenvector basis directly taken from a finite element analysis of modal response. This modal superposition approach is extremely efficient, allowing real-time simulation of hundreds of modes, but has not been demonstrated coupled to aerodynamic and thermal predictions in a closed-loop weapon simulation environment. Thermal predictions may have the most significant effect on structural deformation and therefore aerodynamics, but an effective approach involving a reduced order orthonormal basis is not apparent. Coupling with the aerodynamics results from the thermal and structural forcing function on the airframe being a direct result of the distributed interaction with the impinging airflow. In return, the pressure and heat transfer distribution is a direct function of the airframe shape, orientation, velocity, altitude, and control surface commands.\n\nThe intent of this SBIR topic is to investigate innovative approaches to creating highly-efficient models of evolving FTSI effects for airframes in extreme environments, such as those encountered during high speed flight and the terminal portion of weapons engagement. Ideally the approach would be general and applicable to a wide range of Air Force flight vehicles, although the driving motivation for this topic is hypersonic airframe during long range flight and terminal weapon engagement.",

            "description": "Safety critical systems rely on environmental sensors to determine if an air vehicle is in a valid flight condition. Current environment sensors used for enabling payloads in conventional air launched vehicles include sensing airspeed (wind driven turbines or pitot tubes), sensing of setback at launch, sensing a programmed flight maneuver, etc. New classes of air launched vehicles are being researched that will maintain a sustained Mach 3 to Mach 6+ as they journey to their destination. Environmental sensors are needed to sense the transition from subsonic captive carry flight to sustained hypersonic flight for the purposes of making a valid flight determination that will be used to enable or activate a payload. In addition to sensing hypersonic unique environments, it is desirable to scavenge power from the environment being sensed such that this environment must be present to provide power to a portion of the safety critical subsystem.\n\nInnovative concepts for sensing valid flight and scavenging power should be able to sense and report the transition from subsonic to hypersonic flight by measuring unique stimuli associated with the different high speed airframes of interest. Concepts should have minimal or no impact on performance of the high speed airframe. The airframes being researched include liquid and solid fuel rocket concepts along with scramjet propulsion. Any concept that needs to access airflow outside of the air vehicle's skin or thermal protection system must address survivability and correct operation.  Sensors mounted inside the airframe must meet the mil temp requirements of -56 degrees C to +75 degrees C. Sensors mounted on or integrated with the propulsion section must survive and operated correctly in their planned environment.\n\nSafety requirements dictate that the environmental sensors and their support circuitry will be dedicated to supporting the safety critical subsystem. The environmental sensor itself and the wiring between the environmental sensor(s) and the safety critical subsystem cannot be shared with any other subsystem on the airframe. To facilitate safety analysis for determining adverse failure modes of the environmental sensors, sensing devices and support circuitry should use discrete components and discreet logic elements.\n\nThis topic also needs to address artificial generation of the chosen environment(s) to enable bench top fly out simulations such that environmental sensor performance margins can be tested. If artificial generation of the chosen environment(s) is too complex to achieve under this project during Phase II, then a project plan for developing that environmental simulator needs to be generated as part of this effort.\n\nUnderstanding the Air Force system safety design philosophy is critical to performing this effort. The references describe the requirements for safety critical sensing and future qualification testing that will be required before the new environmental sensing techniques can be implemented on a tactical airframe.",

Weapons with velocities from Mach 5 to 12 and platforms with velocities above Mach 4 will place significant demands on materials used for structures, aeroshells, apertures, control surfaces, and for air-breathing systems, propulsion components. The extremely harsh environment of hypersonic flight requires careful selection of materials by linking material and processing (M&P) properties to system requirements. The high speed systems may be expendable or reusable which places different requirements on the M&P selection. Temperatures can range from 1100 degrees F to 3500 degrees F depending on the vehicle and the location on the vehicle. This requires materials like titanium alloys, superalloys, ceramics and ceramic matrix composites (CMC). Making the wrong selection will increase risk, cost and impact system performance. Currently, materials vendors have material property data for the materials of interest at room temperature. However, material property data for typical use temperatures is limited. Example temperatures of interest are 1100-1200 deg F for titanium alloys, 1600-1800 degrees F for superalloys, and 1600-3500 degrees F for oxide, carbon and SiC reinforced CMCs. The availability of high quality, validated data for all system designers is essential  for making materials selection decisions.\n\nThere is a need to develop methodologies to guide system designers in their material selection process. The methodologies would include components of data compilation with pedigree and validation support, tools and models that utilize M&P data to define the trade space for materials in the extreme environment of high speed flight. Ultimately, the models need to be implemented into a usable development/design tool and procedures identified for model calibration, verification, and validation. The same tools and models will be used by the government scientists and engineers to create government reference vehicles and support the government evaluation of contractor proposals for future hypersonic system weapon system acquisitions.

Weapons with velocities from Mach 5 to 12 and platforms with velocities above Mach 4 will place significant demands on materials used for structures, aeroshells, apertures, control surfaces, and for propulsion components in air-breathing systems. The space shuttle is representative of the state-of-the-art which is a cold structure (aluminum) with a parasitic thermal protection system (TPS) comprised of ceramic tiles and blankets.  The X-51A expendable demonstration vehicle used a similar TPS approach. The parasitic TPS adds weight without adding any structural benefit and lacks the durability required for an operational system. New innovative material concepts are required to enhance durability and carry some of the system loads. The goal is to achieve durability without increasing weight and ultimately reducing the structural weight. The extremely harsh environment of flight above Mach 4 generates surface temperatures from 1000 degrees F to 3500 degrees F depending on the vehicle and the location on the vehicle. For Mach 4-5 vehicles, titanium alloys (1100-1200 degrees F) and superalloys (1600-1800 degrees F) can be used for much of the external surface of the vehicle. As velocity increases, CMCs (oxide, carbon and SiC reinforced) will become the material of choice. Innovative material and processing (M&P) solutions will be required to maintain structural integrity and protect the internal systems from the extreme thermal environment. Advanced materials and concepts which are affordable, extremely light weight, structurally efficient, highly durable, maintainable and supportable are sought. The materials development could be directed to possible hypersonic weapon system as soon as 2025 but probably will have more impact on larger platforms in 2030-2035.\n\nDevelop and demonstrate new M&P concepts that can be scaled-up and integrated into future hypersonic acquisition systems to reduced cost and risk and enhance performance. Concepts to manage the high thermal stresses in the material at the high temperatures, integrated structures where the structural loads are carried by both the internal structure and the outer skin, and materials concepts for highly efficient sandwich structures are options that could be considered but are not considered the only options. The application of an integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) framework with processing data and models linked with property and lifing models is encouraged to be incorporated from the start to enhance the scale-up and transition to an acquisition program. New material concepts are expected to have the greatest payoff for a reusable platform since cost, weight, and risk will be the dominating factors in the acquisition process.

Most of the work has been in aerodynamics, propulsion, and materials. However, sensors are critically important for hypersonic missions. Hardly any investigation has been carried out on sensors for hypersonic air vehicles. The domain of hypersonic flight regime is very large, and conditions and parameters can vary by several orders. It is not possible to develop sensor technologies applicable to all regimes. Therefore, we confine our study to flights at Mach 5 to7 at 30 km altitude.\n\nThe concept of SAR/GMTI from high speed platforms presents several challenges. Some of them are: (1) High platform velocity leads to broad and extended clutter Doppler spectrum, (2) High grazing angles involved results in large ground clutter, (3) High speed and low altitude flights place limits on field of view of the scene, (4) Slender airframes place limits on the size and shape of antenna aperture, (5) High platform speed place limits on real time SAR/GMTI data processing capability, (6) Radar signal frequency and waveform selection has to meet several different requirements (aperture, atmosphere, range and Doppler resolution), and (7) High airframe temperature results in increased antenna noise and hence reduced signal-to-noise ratio. Besides, there are several conflicting requirements that one has contend in this project: The preferred pulse repetition frequency for SAR and GMTI conflict each other. High range resolution requirement will need wide band waveforms. However, this wide band requirement is not good for antenna beam forming requirement. The proposed approach should address all such factors listed above. This project requires good understanding of the hypersonic airplanes, flight conditions, and aerothermodynamics.
