With this interest, a worldwide network of (primarily) radar and optical sensors was piecewise developed, transitioned, and integrated into a system that is now known as the Space Surveillance Network and a global tasking center, the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC). The SSN has the mission of detecting, tracking, cataloging and identifying artificial objects orbiting the Earth, including active and inactive satellites, spent rocket bodies, or fragmentation. However, much of the architecture and operations behind this critical system are limited and outdated including: 1) 24-hour tasking cycle typically via email or stove-pipe mechanism, 2) ad-hoc reactionary tasking via phone, 3) minimal feedback to JSpOC on missed tasking or abnormal detections, 4) little to no information sharing between sensor sites, 5) tasking typically based on set return rate, not information gain expected, and 6) sensor sites do not return possibly beneficial information such as covariance, observation time, observation quality, or sensor specific feature data, such as radar cross-section and visual magnitude.\r\n\r\nThe SSN is in need of innovative techniques and approaches to leverage a future net-centric or grid-enabled infrastructure not bound by the current system limitations. This includes the ability to optimally task sensors such that the maximum information content is returned, Such capabilities would contribute to one or more of the following:\r\n1) Enable real-time information-based tasking and scheduling of distributed, heterogeneous sensors to include real-time feedback \r\n2) Enable the net-centric sharing and utilization of knowledge between sites within a sensor system\r\n3) Enable the prioritization and distributed de-confliction associated with routine and contingency tasking in support of SSA, Space Force Enhancement, and Space Control \r\n4) Enable the distinction between and integration of dedicated, collateral and contributing sensor sites and systems.\r\n\r\nAs appropriate, approximate Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) will include:\r\na) Time from central tasking to acknowledgment of receipt (Goal: 95 percent) \r\nc) Time from collect to data delivery (Goal:", "objective": "Develop and exhibit scalable & extensible technologies that would enable information-based centralized tasking & sensor-based task redistribution of a modernized Space Surveillance Network (SSN) in order to improve Space Situational Awareness (SSA).", "topic_number": "AF151-087", "proposals_end_date": "2015-02-18T05:00:00Z", "pre_release_date": "2014-12-12T05:00:00Z"}, "pk": 1}, {"model": "sbirez.topic", "fields": {"program": "SBIR", "proposals_begin_date": "2015-01-15T05:00:00Z", "agency": "AirForce", "solicitation_id": "DoD SBIR 2015.1", "title": "Advanced Experimental Design and Modeling and Simulation for Testing Large Format Sensor Arrays", "saved_by": [], "url": "http://www.dodsbir.net/sitis/display_topic.asp?Bookmark=46458", "description": "New test techniques are needed to test next generation imaging, multi- and hyper-spectral, and wide-field-of-view (WFOV) sensor systems with large-format focal plane arrays using large-format projection systems.

However, many licensed bands, such as those for TV broadcasting, are underutilized, resulting in spectrum wastage [ref 2]. This has encouraged the FCC to open the licensed bands to unlicensed users using cognitive radio (CR) technology [ref 3]. \r\n\r\nTo do so, the unlicensed users or secondary users (SUs), need to monitor the activities of the licensed users or primary users (PUs), to find spectrum holes (SHs), which are defined as the spectrum bands that can be used by the SUs without interfering with the PUs. This procedure is called spectrum sensing [ref 4-7]. There are two types of SHs, temporal and spatial SHs [ref 5]. A temporal SH appears when there is no PU transmission during a certain time period and the SUs can use the spectrum for transmission. A spatial SH appears when the PU transmission is within an area and the SUs can use the spectrum outside that area. For this application, hostile jamming can also be considered a class of PU, in that such interference sources are to be avoided. \r\n\r\nWith CR, the users can recognize the enemy and friendly communications and protect their own. Moreover, the users can search for more transmission opportunities. Prior programs such as SPEAKeasy radio system and next Generation (XG) sought to exploit the benefits of CR techniques. This topic seeks to pursue how PNT ranging signals from space (and potentially ground) sources would employ CR technology. \r\n\r\nOfferors should clearly indicate how they are pursuing a local SH sensing system and the SH sensing system\u0092s integration into the overall PNT RF system targeting the L, S, and C bands. As frequencies change, transmitted power may have to change in order to maintain the needed carrier-to-noise density ratio. Proposers should indicate how collaborative spectrum sensing (CSS) will be implemented and how the collaboration of several SUs for spectrum sensing will improve the detection performance by taking advantage of independent fading channels and multiuser diversity. \r\n\r\nRefs. 1 and 3 should provide a starting point for development of the CR system and the parameters of merit for such a system, specifically:\r\n- Spectrum decision making: consists of two steps. Each spectrum band is characterized, based on not only local observations of CR users but also statistical information of primary networks. Then, based on this characterization, the most appropriate spectrum band can be chosen. For PNT CR systems, primary users must not be interrupted as a primary performance parameter.\r\n- Spectrum mobility in the time domain:  how CR networks adapt to the wireless spectrum based on the available bands. \r\n- Spectrum mobility in space: how available bands change as a user/transmitter moves from one place to another.\r\n\r\nNotional operations concepts should be developed for local monitoring, control of satellite assets, and coordination with users. Based on proposed decision fusion criteria, CSS can be realized in either a centralized or a distributed manner. Both wideband spectrum sensing and sensing strategies synchronized with other military applications are of topical interest. \r\n\r\nThis topic does not require trades studies on how to alter the entire Global Positioning System (GPS) constellation and is considering only potential limited augmentations to it. \r\n\r\nNo use of government materials, equipment, data, or facilities is contemplated in this topic.", "objective": "Design, model, and validate cognitive radio technology to mitigate limited licensed spectrum by accessing efficiently unlicensed spectrum bands in support of military space based PNT needs on a non-interference basis.", "topic_number": "AF15-AT23", "proposals_end_date": "2015-02-18T05:00:00Z", "pre_release_date": "2014-12-12T05:00:00Z"}, "pk": 5}, {"model": "sbirez.topic", "fields": {"program": "SBIR", "proposals_begin_date": "2015-01-15T05:00:00Z", "agency": "AirForce", "solicitation_id": "DoD SBIR 2015.1", "title": "Defect Mitigation Processes for III-V-based Infrared Detectors", "saved_by": [], "url": "http://www.dodsbir.net/sitis/display_topic.asp?Bookmark=46426", "description": "The Air Force has multiple critical airborne and space-based applications requiring infrared detection systems with lower cost, size, weight, and power, increased resolution, larger formats, increased reliability, and improved sustainability. The III-V infrared superlattice materials hold promise to significantly lower the cost of existing infrared detection systems due to their advantages over present detectors comprised of bulk materials. These advantages, including less cooling required due to higher operating temperatures, increased manufacturability from leveraging domestic III-V foundries, and increased yield resulting from more uniform deposition on larger substrates, all translate into lower cost while maintaining or increasing performance. Although significant improvements over the last 20-30 years in III-V superlattice material growth, surface passivation, and detector fabrication have created the current state-of-the-art detectors (e.g., high operating temperature at about 150 K, mid-wavelength infrared focal plane array detectors), the remaining elusive materials defects are limiting the operating temperature from reaching 200 K. These defects are possibly point defects native to the materials, or they may be due to crystal defects, such as threading dislocations, resulting in dangling bonds within the material bulk. Such defects can act as deep level trap states, generation centers, or shallow level defect states that decrease the material minority carrier lifetime and Hall mobility and increase the detector dark current while lowering the quantum efficiency. By applying appropriate defect mitigation processes, the number of active defect states can be reduced, thereby improving the material properties necessary to optimize the detector performance for higher operating temperatures. Processes such as post-growth annealing and hydrogenation may improve the material minority carrier lifetime and mobility and thus the detector dark current and quantum efficiency, indicating promise to deactivate material defects behaving as scattering and recombination centers or as deep level traps. A variety of innovative post-growth process techniques may be proposed to address defect mitigation in infrared InAs/InGaSb and InAs/InAsSb superlattice materials and detectors.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this program is to systematically explore and develop post-growth defect mitigation processes that can improve the III-V infrared superlattice minority carrier lifetime by at least 10X, Hall mobility by 5-10X, and/or detector dark current by at least 10X at temperatures from 77 K to 200 K. These processes must be thermally compatible with arsenide-antimonide materials and not cause contamination or degradation of the superlattice materials. The stability of the defect mitigation processes must be assessed over time for at least six months and over temperature for at least 20 cycles from 77 K to 300 K.\r\n\r\nThe potential for future commercialization of these defect mitigation processes exists to improve device performance not only of III-V superlattice infrared detectors but also emitters (laser diodes, light emitting diodes) and multi-junction solar cells.  Military applications, including Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance as well as Space Situational Awareness, would benefit from the use of these improved high-performance infrared detectors for imaging and characterizing objects of different temperatures.

Some of these, such as scintillation, are disruptive to the function of RF systems that depend on transionospheric propagation, while other effects, such as refraction and reflection, are the key enabling effects that allow systems to operate, especially at lower frequencies. Some of the deleterious effects of the ionosphere on systems can be overcome by adding plasma to the environment to smooth out irregularities or prevent conditions necessary for development of turbulence. Artificial plasmas can also be used to directly enhance system performance by enabling propagation paths not possible in the natural environment. Artificial plasma production using high-power transmitters has been envisioned for many decades (Koert, 1991), and demonstrated at relatively low densities using ground-based facilities (Pedersen et al., 2010), but the large investment in transmitter infrastructure required limits practical applications of these techniques. Plasma enhancement by chemical means, such as barium releases or chemionization, overcomes many of these logistical difficulties. But current technologies for chemical releases are typically limited to impulsive dispersal leading to initially spherical clouds or continuous dispersal producing an elongated trail along the trajectory of the host vehicle, as in TMA releases. The fraction of the payload taken up by the canisters, dispersal system, and energy source is also very high, leaving as little as 10% of the mass for the actual plasma-producing material. Innovative techniques that could achieve high ionization efficiency, high payload mass fraction, and controlled dispersal patterns both in time and space are needed to begin development of practical applications of artificial plasma techniques. Early stages of this effort would require modeling of material properties and ionization and dispersal processes, while later stages would involve design and construction of a prototype that could be used to demonstrate functionality in the space environment. Designs that could be readily accommodated on a variety of vehicles, such as by fitting within cubesat form factors, are strongly preferred. Successful proposers must demonstrate solid understanding of the various processes involved in producing artificial space plasmas, including generation of gas-phase substances, ionization and recombination reactions in the space environment, expansion and diffusion of neutral and ion clouds, plasma flow across and along the magnetic field, and avoidance of byproducts which could quench the plasma.", "objective": "Identify suitable materials and model, design and build a light-weight throttleable directional mechanism for controlled production and dispersal of artificial plasma into the space environment.", "topic_number": "AF15-AT22", "proposals_end_date": "2015-02-18T05:00:00Z", "pre_release_date": "2014-12-12T05:00:00Z"}, "pk": 9}, {"model": "sbirez.topic", "fields": {"program": "SBIR", "proposals_begin_date": "2015-01-15T05:00:00Z", "agency": "AirForce", "solicitation_id": "DoD SBIR 2015.1", "title": "Novel Penetrator Cases for Explosive and Fuze Survivability", "saved_by": [], "url": "http://www.dodsbir.net/sitis/display_topic.asp?Bookmark=46401", "description": "Penetrating weapons experience tremendous shock loads on the explosive fills and fuze components.  This problem is only expected to worsen as weapon velocities and strength of materials in targets increase.\r\n\r\nOne approach is to use an interior structure in the warhead cavity that would reduce movement and displacement in the explosive during penetration.  There are two ways this might be implemented: (1) the explosive might fill an open cellular structure like a linear cellular array [Ref. 1] and/or an open cell foam [Ref. 2, 3], or (2) the explosive might be subdivided into discrete modules or compartmentalized by baffles or barriers.

The cost of exploring this wide design space can be reduced with predictive, physics-based simulation capabilities.\r\n\r\nPredictive high-speed device simulation requires hot electron transport with electronic band structure and explicit electron scattering. The transport model should also be numerically efficient, couple readily to electromagnetic (EM) fields, and accommodate both fast and slow physical processes.\r\n\r\nHigh frequency simulation also requires full wave EM. In the THz range, field fluctuations are comparable to the electron momentum relaxation rate [1], causing the device to transition from nonlinear active to linear passive behavior. Propagation delays and inductive coupling can also be apparent at even lower frequencies, below 70 GHz [2]. These effects require full wave EM, i.e., including Ampere\u0092s and Faraday\u0092s laws among the device equations.\r\n\r\nOne hot electron model is ensemble Monte Carlo (EMC). This method stochastically tracks mobile charges as they drift in EM fields and scatter randomly in momentum space. With electronic band structure, it can be highly accurate.  However, the stochastic algorithm has difficulty treating both fast and slow processes. Moreover, EMC is very computer intensive, particularly with full wave EM.\r\n\r\nEnergy transport models, such as hydrodynamics, are more numerically efficient.  However, they typically exhibit numerical instabilities, and accuracy requires fitting parameters, such as field-dependent mobility.\r\n\r\nFull wave EM for semiconductor devices is generally treated with the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. It is conceptually simple and can represent divergence and curl operators in a consistent way. However, it requires a structured mesh and decouples the field and charge dynamics in time, such that they are never solved simultaneously. Stability issues often require highly absorbent perfectly matched layer boundary conditions when FDTD is coupled to nonlinear charge transport.\r\n\r\nThis project concerns simulation different in both the transport and EM components. Mobile charges are treated with Fermi kinetics transport (FKT), an energy transport model based on thermal physics of ideal Fermi gases. It includes the thermodynamic identity to enforce the 2nd law of thermodynamics throughout the simulation domain [3].

Assigning rotational fields to primary and dual edges and applying the Stokes theorem approximates the curl operators in Ampere\u0092s and Faraday\u0092s laws in a manner compatible with the box integration method\u0092s divergence operators.

Many factors affect how reverberant the environment is, such as the size of the room, type of automobile, the material used in the buildings and so on.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made since the 1960s using different techniques but until now the topic is still an active area of research due to two main reasons: The first is that many of the developed techniques degrade the quality of the original signal after de-reverberation. This represents a serious problem especially if the de-reverberated signal will be used in a successive stage where sound features are extracted to be used in automatic speech or speaker recognition. The second reason is that many techniques depend on the knowledge of the exact effect of the environment, which makes the performance of these techniques suitable only for specific environments, and/or depends on some parameters that cannot be assumed to be known in practical cases.\r\n\r\nThis technology could be applied to military applications such as speech analysis, or to communication telephony (i.e., hands free in an automobile).

One technology that can markedly impact this problem is the Calculation of Phase Diagrams (CALPHAD) method [2]. These are thermodynamic models for making quantitative predictions of phase equilibria, volume fraction, solidification paths, and other thermodynamic quantities of engineering materials. Currently, hypothetical questions involving systems with 10-plus components can be answered about metallic systems from desktop CALPHAD software systems. Such results provide the fundamental underpinnings of evolutionary and revolutionary materials development. Expanding the reach of these tools would accelerate materials development and implementation across the transportation and energy generation (turbine engine) communities. The main sources of error in these methods are the availability and accuracy of multi-component databases, the physical and numerical representation of the thermodynamic quantities and the stability of the multivariate solvers. Developing these databases is costly and time consuming and the underlying structure representing this data in the CALPHAD methods is inflexible, requiring significant hard coding to incorporate new or improved experimental data. Significantly advancing the CALPHAD methods requires changes in the structure and extensibility of the databases which would lead to a natural, community-driven evolution of the underlying data. Advances in these methods should also include Bayesian, or its equivalent, methods for managing and reducing the intrinsic errors in the predicted properties. Further, the methods should provide feedback to the user based on what experimental data (phases, chemistry and temperature) are needed to improve the accuracy of the approach for a particular problem. Finally, rapid, parallel and robust experimental-testing techniques need to be developed to provide the breadth of thermodynamic data needed for these databases. In order to reach the stated ICME goal of a 50 percent reduction in time and cost, proposals are sought for developing technologies that produce rapid and accurate thermodynamic predictions through (but not limited to): accelerated development of thermodynamic databases, new easily extensible databases, more accurate thermodynamic models [3], advanced application of multivariate solvers, Bayesian methods for improving precision and feedback to the user on the optimum pathway for improving the databases for a specific application.", "objective": "Significantly accelerate the development, deployment and accuracy of thermodynamic and kinetic databases used in the Integrated Computational Materials Engineering processes.", "topic_number": "AF15-AT30", "proposals_end_date": "2015-02-18T05:00:00Z", "pre_release_date": "2014-12-12T05:00:00Z"}, "pk": 17}, {"model": "sbirez.topic", "fields": {"program": "SBIR", "proposals_begin_date": "2015-01-15T05:00:00Z", "agency": "AirForce", "solicitation_id": "DoD SBIR 2015.1", "title": "Prognostic Scheduling", "saved_by": [], "url": "http://www.dodsbir.net/sitis/display_topic.asp?Bookmark=46455", "description": "The Air Force's Air Logistics Complexes (ALC) are tasked with the responsibility of maintaining the Air Force\u0092s fleet.

GMTI processing includes detection, geolocation, and tracking of multiple moving and stationary targets. In recent years, SAR has been used in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms due to all-weather exploitation, video SAR formation, and long-range coverage. Unlike conventional radar, SAR can provide video of the interrogated scene and detection and tracking capabilities. In addition, using a SAR system, a target could be detected without a minimum detectable velocity (i.e., detection of move-stop-move target). Furthermore, SAR-GMTI processing can be accomplished using a single phase center/single channel. However, multiple moving targets detection, geolocation, tracking, in complex environment is a challenging problem. This is due to the fact that moving targets'' signature Doppler shift and smear because of velocity of the targets and radar. Moreover, noise of the operating environments and clutter sources add complexity to detect and track targets. Hence, the goal of this research is to develop a unified theory for multiple moving targets detection, geolocation, and tracking in complex, heterogeneous clutter environments.\r\n\r\nResearchers developed theories and algorithms to address the GMTI processing [1-5]. Among different techniques, scientists developed a strategy to focus the energy of a moving target so that it could be detected and tracked. However, geolocation problems are left unresolved or operating environments with multiple targets or weak targets (i.e., low radar cross section targets) have not been considered for these solutions. Some researchers have implemented \u0093ad hoc\u0094 techniques (i.e., GMTI algorithms) for target detection and tracking that work on some specific data set only.\r\n\r\nThe emphasis of this research will be fundamental understanding of moving target phenomenology under SAR and incorporating those findings for GMTI algorithm development. First, research needs to be conducted to fully understand the parameters that influence defocussing/smearing of moving targets\u0092 signature. Second, we have to investigate the influence of noise and clutter on multiple moving targets detection, geolocation, and tracking. Third, we have to examine waveforms\u0092 role for targets detection. Fourth, we need to evaluate different tracking algorithms and select the one that will perform the best for a given operating environment. Fifth, we may need to incorporate prior information of the interrogated scene for geolocation accuracy. Computational costs associated with real-time execution of the proposed algorithms should be fully analyzed. The ability to integrate these areas into a unified systems theory prototype to allow system trade studies may also be needed. By addressing the above mentioned technical barriers and developing a system trade space analysis capability, we may reach a comprehensive solution and unified theory for GMTI processing that is vital for improving performance of modern persistent ISR systems.

While the late-time ( about 1 ms) species emissions are well-characterized, the early-time chemical cascade (about 1 \u00b5s) is poorly understood. Spectral feature identification and source characterization in the field is arduous due to a lack of algorithms and software that can process such data in real time.

SAL operates according to the same principles as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), enabling the capture of images with a synthetic aperture much larger than the physical aperture, and resulting in high resolution images at longer ranges than possible with a physical aperture. Compared to SAR, SAL operates at wavelengths less than 1/1000 that of SAR, providing much higher resolution and can provide images with the fidelity needed for target identification. Because SAL operates at wavelengths similar to visible wavelengths, images from a SAL system are readily interpretable by humans without training.\r\n\r\nNon-mechanical beam steering (NMBS) is a technology that provides the ability to direct a laser beam without physical movement of the optical elements. Although NMBS techniques have been demonstrated to steer optical imagery for conventional focal plane imagery, NMBS has not been shown to operate with a SAL system. NMBS offers similar advantages to a SAL sensor as it does to direct detection ladar, such as reduced weight, random access to steering directions, and expanded field of view. Due to long ranges and the correspondingly long time of flight, there is the potential for SAL systems to handle multiple look directions simultaneously. In addition, because of the long ranges that SAL is expected to operate at, the ability of NMBS to provide high speed beam stabilization is an additional benefit that could be realized.\r\n\r\nTo date, the most effective NMBS systems operate using liquid crystal devices to modify the phase of the beam to steer the beam. While in direct detection ladar systems, the phase changes are not a significant concern, in a coherent ladar, such as SAL, the effect of the NMBS system on the phase is critically important. To date current NMBS devices have not demonstrated compatibility with coherent ladar systems. \r\n\r\nCommercial application of a NMBS with SAL sensors would provide similar benefits to military systems.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this effort is to demonstrate a NMBS technology that is compatible with a SAL sensor, which could be used in a target pod to support long range target identification. The NMBS should show capability to steer a SAL system with minimal impact to performance. The primary SAL wavelength of interest is 1.5 micron, however operations from 1 to 2 microns can be considered. The steering system should be capable of scaling to 15 cm apertures. The steering system should be capable of steering 45 degrees off-boresight. Continuous steering is preferred, but not required.

Current technology uses perforated liners to damp high frequency instabilities.  However, in general acoustic liners have a limited damping capability below 1000 Hz and traditional Helmholtz-type resonators for low frequencies result in significant issues with weight (tens of pounds), size (characteristic lengths of a foot or more), and packaging.  Empirical correlations are typically used for designing acoustic liners that are based on parameters such as effective area of the perforated holes, flow length scales and engine cycle temperatures and pressures.  These designs are then tested in rigs and engines to show their damping effectiveness.  Oftentimes the design needs to be modified after the engine test since typical engine conditions are not easily attained in a rig test.  In the absence of a detailed design database and procedure, current design methodologies are questionable, especially for next generation systems, for which boundary conditions such as temperature, vitiation level, operating pressure, velocity/Mach number, and turbulence levels are expected to be more severe.

EO/IR sensors can provide high spatial resolution images using multiband of frequencies ranging from the visible to mid-wave IR. EO/IR sensors have been very successful for terrain imaging from subsonic aircraft. However, the study of such sensors on-board hypersonic platforms has not been carried out in any detail thus far. There are several new challenges for EO/IR sensing that hypersonic vehicles present. Hypersonic flights produce a shock layer where part of the kinetic energy is transformed to heat. This then leads to hot flow, heated airframes and sensor bay windows. For instance, the outside temperature of sensor windows can be as high as 1000 degrees C. This condition places serious limits on the signal-to-noise ratio that can be achieved by the EO/IR sensors. For satisfactory operation of onboard sensors the sensor bay has to be maintained at 30 degrees C. Thus the window material has to perform satisfactorily even when it is subjected to such large temperature stress. Because of the need to image a large terrain strip the field of view of the EO/IR sensors has to be as large as 50 degrees. This requires a large size window. Note that a large window which meets all the requirements (withstand thermal stress, EO/IR transparency, physical strength, insulating capability, non-radiating) is hard to be found. Vibration and high-G maneuvers can considerably degrade high resolution imaging. Shock layer and boundary layer inhomogeneities can significantly refract and scatter EO/IR signals thereby degrading image quality. A good understanding of hypersonic air vehicles and aerothermodynamics is important for this project. Only then a realistic estimate of all the above mentioned effects is possible. Impact of the atmosphere on EO/IR signals is well known.

Calibration refers to the fact that the image is not simply a greyscale infrared image: each pixel in the infrared image will have a radiance value. The \u0093target\u0094 will typically be a threat target, such as a T-72 tank. \r\n\r\nThe signature measurement process has three key requirements:\r\n1. Target measurements are conducted at a fixed location(s). In rare instances customers require measurements to occur at remote locations.\r\n2. Measurements are taken in sets of images throughout a day. Measurements must occur before and after sunrise and sunset, as well as other times to accurately characterize a target.\r\n3. The images of a target must be collected at multiple specific cardinal points for each set, at a constant range for each point. These cardinal points are defined by specific aspect and depression angles, specified by a customer of the data. A typical set of aspect angles will be 45, 135, 225, and 315 degrees, with each aspect angle being measured at depression angles of 0, 30, and 60 degrees. The range to the target must be sufficient so that the infrared cameras can view the entire target in a single frame, and the range must be constant: it must be the same range for each measurement.\r\n\r\nIt is also noteworthy that each measurement set is calibrated. Calibration sources constitute a separate target. The cameras are interchangeable within the collection system, and are frequently updated as new sensor technology becomes available. Targets can be widely varied in both size and configuration.\r\n\r\nThere are two traditional techniques to conduct infrared signature measurement to meet the key requirements above, specifically, the third requirement.\r\n\r\nThese methods have shortcomings which are noted below:\r\n1. The target is placed on a turntable to change the aspect angle, and the sensors are placed on a lift, to adjust the cameras\u0092 depression angle. The turntable method is now an invalid signature measurement technique because the target rotation heats the target evenly, and is not considered operationally realistic.\r\n2. The current state-of-the-art method is a collapsible tower (with multiple cameras mounted to the top of the tower) attached to an instrumentation van. The instrumentation van drives to the desired aspect angle, and the tower is raised to the desired height to achieve the required depression angle. The sensors collect the data, and the raw data is transmitted via multiple GigE streams to computer systems inside the van.

Raising and lowering the tower in this manner significantly slows data collection. \r\n(2) Available commercial off-the-shelf towers that can be operated safely for the van configuration have a limited height, and this limits the depression angles that can be utilized for target measurement. These shortcomings limit the quality of the signature data.\r\n\r\nThe requirement for this SBIR is an innovative new system to improve three metrics: \r\n(1) The innovative system must increase the speed at which a single set of data can be collected beyond the current state-of-the-art method.\r\n(2) The innovative system must improve collection versatility by increasing depression angles beyond current state-of-the-art.

However, vision sensors have limited utility at night or in fog or rain. Although infrared sensors may be used at night, they, too, have poor performance due to significant signal attenuation in rain and fog. Atmospheric windows exist in the millimeter wave band (at frequencies of 35, 94, 140, and 220 GHz) that have much less attenuation in rain and fog than visible or IR. Thus, a sensor operating in one of these bands that can use optic flow or feature tracking to aid the navigation system is highly desirable as an all-weather solution for GPS-denied operation. Furthermore, a passive system is preferred to minimize the risk of detection by an adversary.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most limiting factor for a PMMW sensor is Rayleigh's criterion, which states that the resolution of a sensor is proportional to wavelength and inversely proportional to detector size. Thus, a PMMW sensor must have a much larger aperture to have the same effective resolution as a visible sensor. Nevertheless, the potential of this technology is very appealing for all weather operation.\r\n\r\nWe are seeking significant advances in sensor and processing technology that will make a PMMW sensor a viable navigation aid for a small UAV (with a wingspan of 5 meters or less) or a munition.

This research centers on the development of techniques that allow sparse or compressible signals (not strictly images) to be reconstructed from samples taken at rates significantly below the Nyquist rate. A particularly interesting application of this theory is the development of single-pixel cameras from which a fairly highly resolved image can be reconstructed, as well as low-resolution cameras from which significantly higher resolution images can be recreated. A motivating factor for this prior work has been the realization that in most imaging sensors, huge focal plane arrays are used to acquire the raw image, but the raw data is immediately subjected to compression algorithms that essentially \"throw\" away a large quantity of the collected data (e.g., JPEG compression) with minimal impact on the information content of the image. The thought behind the application of compressive sensing is that rather than using a sensor system that requires high-rate sampling followed by extreme data compression, simply develop a sensor system that initially makes low-rate measurements directly in the compressive domain. Under the compressive sensing theory, it is possible to show that under some reasonable assumptions about the sensed signal and the selection of a measurement matrix that satisfies certain reasonable conditions, a signal can be perfectly reconstructed with sparse (well below Nyquist) sampling.  A natural progression from the realization that a signal can be reconstructed from these sparse measurements is the realization that it should be possible to perform processing operations on the equivalent representation of the sensor data in the low-dimensional sparse domain directly rather than first having to reconstruct the signal. Obviously, if the signal can be reconstructed from the sparse measurements all the information available from a reconstructed signal must be present in the sparse measurement domain. Therefore, it should be possible to perform processing and reasoning techniques directly in the measurement domain without going to the expense of signal reconstruction. This possibility is particularly attractive in applications (like machine learning and computer vision) where there is no real need to recreate the signal if the required processing can be accomplished directly in the sparse domain. There would be at least two advantages to being able to perform signal processing directly in the sparse measurement domain. The most obvious advantage being elimination of the costs (resources/time) to reconstruct the signal. A second advantage may be a reduction in the raw computational throughput required that results from the significant reduction in the sheer quantity of the raw data (i.e., data quantity commensurate with the sparsity of the measurement space). A particular application for this conjectured capability is in weapon seeker design for an autonomous weapon. Being able to collect data in a sparse measurement space and perform the required target detection and classification tasks directly in the space would theoretically reduce the sensor H/W complexity as well as the processing throughput requirements - thereby significantly reducing the seeker cost.

As an example, in 2011, the entire F-22 fleet was grounded for nearly five months due to a series of incidents where pilots had experienced symptoms such as shortness of breath, disorientation, confusion, and headache with no clear cause identified. This led to a series of formal investigations that identified the need to improve our analytical toolset and understanding of the environments encountered in the F22A Raptor and other high performance aircraft, and their effects on the humans operating them.\r\n\r\nModern high performance aircraft, such as the F22A, utilize engine bleed air filtered through an onboard oxygen generating systems to provide the oxygen supply for air crew.  The OBOGS (On-Board Oxygen Generating System) uses a molecular sieve to concentrate oxygen in pressurized air from the turbine engine compressor on a schedule associated with aircraft altitude in order to compensate for the decrease in oxygen partial pressure and to protect the pilot against rapid decompression.  Investigations conducted by the Air Force of in-flight, physiological incidents did not identify contaminants as a root cause in any reported cases; however, a gap exists in the ability for real-time monitoring of the pilot air supply. Development of an orthogonal sensor suite for use in flight will enable continuous assessment of pilot air quality and will prove invaluable in the evaluation of OBOGS efficiency and pilot safety.  Finally, real-time detection of potential contaminants would allow investigators to determine if those compounds may contribute to future incidents and, if so, what the source is, thus enabling engineers to eliminate or mitigate the problem and ensure protection of the pilots and their full capability to operate the aircraft.\r\n\r\nMonitoring the OBOGS product air in-flight presents many technical challenges not faced by ground based air quality analysis [1-5]. As high-performance aircraft are extremely limited in terms of space and weight, any fielded sensor packages must be minimal in terms of their space footprint and weight. The device must function in a high oxygen, low humidity environment which may experience rapid altitude (pressure) changes as dictated by the mission [6].  Additionally, as the developed sensor platform would be used for both determination of atmospheric gas make-up as well as broad screening of potential volatile contaminants, a variety of sensor technologies (i.e., utilizing techniques such as ion mobility spectrometry) may be required for detection of volatile compounds at thresholds below physiological relevance [7-8]. Design considerations will also have to be made for a platform which performs non-obstructive sample collection in the pilot air stream, does not introduce potential leaks in the air supply, and contains all required electronics and algorithms necessary for signal processing, compound identification and quantitation, display, and data logging.

These efforts should advance the state of the art compared to turbo-generator power generation units, via SWAP and fuel consumption. There are several types of fuel cells; however, the hydrogen fueled PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) type is probably the most suitable at this time. The DOE has several programs working the development of fuel cells for automotive and other applications. These programs include the logistics of hydrogen fuel production and storage as well as the cells themselves. Based on this work, the time is now for AFRL to get involved and start planning the integration of fuel cell technology to provide the prime power for present and future advanced weapons systems, such as typical GA MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and up to combat aircraft, such as the JSF F-35. Projected burst mode power requirements range from 100kW to1MW average power. The projected energy capability should be traceable to more than 25MJ per mission. The optimum use of fuel cells for pulsed power systems uses the fuel cell to deliver a relatively constant power direct current that is stored in a Li-ion or Li-polymer battery, in combination with power electronics, to provide the high peak pulsed power to the load. An interesting advanced commercial PEM fuel cell rated at 110kW available from Nuvera [1]. Hydrogen storage and logistics problems are also being addressed in terms of existing components and technologies [2,3]. Fuel cells are ideal for typical AFRL pulsed power weapons applications. PEM fuel cells have no start-up time compared to turbo-generator prime power sources. The fuel cell approach advances the state of the arr by the fact that there is essentially no mechanical inertial or electrical inductance that seriously degrades the conventional appraoch of turbo-generators.  In missions that require a long stand-by mode a turbo-generator has to be running, no load, at rated speed in order to provide fire power on demand. Typically, a turbine consumes about 70 percent of the full power fuel when running at rated speed and no-load. This obviously results in very high fuel consumption for missions requiring extended ready mode duration. PEM cells in addition to having a higher efficiency, do not consume fuel at no-load, provide fire power on demand from a cold stand-by, and converts the fuel directly into direct current. The SOFC (solid oxide fuel cell) [4] is also a possible candidate for prime power. The SOFC fuel requirement consists has a wide range of acceptable fuel, including JP-8, ethanol, propane, and most hydrocarbons. However, the SOFC operates at a temperature of approximately 800 degrees C and therefore does not have an instantaneous start up time.

Affordability and availability should continue to be addressed by using commercial fabrication facilities to fabricate military-unique designs.\r\n\r\nFlat panel technologies revolutionized cockpits during the 1990s and were the basis for an epochal shift from electromechanical and cathode-ray tube flight instruments to the avionics-grade sunlight-readable, reliable, active matrix liquid crystal displays (AMLCDs) that now dominate crew station design. Large-area AMLCDs have enabled the realization, in the F-35 cockpit, of the combat advantage demonstrated in the 1988-1992 AFRL ATD entitled Panoramic Cockpit Controls and Displays (PCCADS).

With each conjunction the operator must determine the likelihood of the conjunction, the associated risk level, and the appropriate course of action. When determining the likelihood of a conjunction, today, the operator primarily considers two factors: probability of collision and miss distance. Each of these metrics has their own inherent problems. Miss distance cannot be solely considered since two conjuncting assets may have a miss distance less than 20 km however if the covariance matrix for each object is small then the risk factor of the conjunction is relatively small. Conversely, the miss distance could also be large, but if the covariance matrix for one of the objects is larger than the miss distance between the two objects then the conjunction still has a relatively high risk factor. There are similar concerns when considering probability of collision. In addition a covariance matrix does not fully take into account raw sensor data and its biases.  Typically the raw sensor data is fused into a flawed derived orbital product. A low probability of collision can result from both an unlikely event and a large covariance matrix.

For superior payload capability and increased risk mitigation redundancy for DoD space assets, a high efficiency EP technology compatible with chemical propellants could be paired with a chemical thruster to produce an agile and efficient multi-mode propulsion (MMP) system.  An agile MMP system with shared propellant and tanks reduces system complexity and increases risk mitigation redundancy by enabling flexible and optimal utilization of propellant between the EP and chemical thruster system for in-space maneuvers, including orbit transfer, repositioning, station-keeping, attitude control, and disposal.

Further, inexpensive electronic attack systems can limit our ability to collect reliable ISR from mono-static platforms.  Hence, to address these onerous technical challenges for contested/anti-access area denial (A2AD) environment, the Air Force must develop affordable, low-cost ISR systems with advanced exploitation capabilities.  In general, future ISR systems must be designed so that unauthorized users cannot penetrate to downgrade our ISR capabilities at any critical chain (transmit, receive, and processing) of operation.  Our transmit signals must be designed in such a way that an enemy cannot see our presence.\r\n\r\nRecently, researchers have developed theoretical foundation for spread spectrum coded linear frequency modulation (LFM) transmit signal that has potentials for solving some of the above mentioned technical challenges of the contested environment [1-2].  Some of the characteristics of these signals are: (a) inherit properties of direct sequence spread spectrum and LFM waveforms, (b) remain almost orthogonal on both transmit and receive, and (c) can hide while operating in adversaries environments.  In addition, when properly processed, two important benefits of these signals are: (a) can provide exploitation capabilities that LFM waveforms exhibit (i.e., Doppler tolerant) and (b) can achieve high resolution imaging capability to separate a weak target that is close to a strong target. Other approaches on waveforms design and exploitations can be found in various literatures [3-5].\r\n\r\nWe are seeking sensor technology development to accomplish both (1) transmit signal design and (2) exploitation algorithms for simultaneous SAR and GMTI processing.

These maintenance procedures add additional risk to the maintenance of aircraft.  Tire failures can often be attributed to lapses in maintenance.

However, this protective capability must also be properly balanced against mission requirements and system resource limitations, to prevent the unnecessary depletion of said resources or impacts to the mission (e.g. ambiguous sensor readings lead the satellite to maneuver which in turn reduces the system\u0092s station keeping capability, effectively shortening the satellite\u0092s service life).\r\n\r\nThe Air Force Research Laboratory believes that enabling these protective responses at a temporally effective pace will require increased levels of system autonomy to identify, assess,  recommend, and eventually choose, plan and execute appropriate protective courses of action.

Ceramic matrix composites (CMC) are a promising high temperature material for aerospace applications. Recently, several successful demonstrations of CMC hot section turbine engine components have been executed. There are several benefits in using CMCs over traditional Ni-based super alloys which include improved durability at elevated temperatures, increased thrust-to-weight ratio and improved specific fuel consumption. While the need for CMCs is apparent, the current transition path for materials is based on metal alloys and does not account for the unique aspects of CMCs. Innovative testing methodologies and physics based computational tools that capture relevant environmental factors while accounting for the unique aspects of CMCs are needed to fully exploit their use for hot section turbine engine components. \r\n\r\nMost of the current research and available property data on CMCs are based on flat panel coupon testing. However, CMC components in advanced turbine engine applications are highly complex. Components such as turbine blades and vanes require ply drops, curved plies, and/or matrix rich regions which have not been studied extensively. Additionally, the complexity of the CMCs architecture could cause other manufacturing defects such as porosity and ply wrinkles that can affect component durability. These components also face combined mechanical loading and thermal gradients resulting in complex stress states that are not captured in most standard tests.  Combined environmental and mechanical damage will have a significant impact on CMC component life. \r\n\r\nThe evaluation of CMC turbine engine components in relevant service environments requires the application of extreme environments (high pressure, hot gases and moisture) and complex loads (bi-axial, vibratory and thermal gradients). Despite using established testing methods designed for metals throughout the component\u0092s building block development (coupons, sub-elements, sub-scale components, etc.), unanticipated failures still occur when the hardware is rolled up into a complete full scale engine demonstrator test in part due to the complexity of the loading and service environment. Preexisting service damage also impacts the service life CMC components.\r\n\r\nConsequently, new and innovative methods are needed to verify the anticipated component performance and generate confidence in new designs and technologies as early in the development process as possible, while providing a reduction in cost and test time prior to their introduction into full-scale engines.  Currently, empirical curves are generated from design allowables of flat panels to life CMC components. The current approach requires a prolonged development time and does not capture the complexity of CMC components. The preferred method will combine experimental and analytical aspects with the goal of developing lifing tools to reduce the amount of testing needed and capture the complexity of CMCs. The proposed method needs to predict the service life of CMC engine components within a determined fidelity of prediction. It also should focus on first order effects that limit service life.

Despite commanders stating that personnel are the most valuable asset, when budgets decrease, training is often the first thing cut. It is imperative that, as we move to even more complex operational environments, we are leveraging developing technologies to ensure our airmen are developing and maintaining competency. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Air Force training is based on a one-size-fits-all approach that involves instructor-led classroom-based training and document reading-based certification. The degree to which a particular student develops competency from these approaches is rarely assessed. The state-of the-art in Air Force training research is the development of adaptive, personalized competency-based training technology which emphasizes the development of proficiency instead of simply tracking completion. \r\n\r\nTo accomplish this goal will require the development of an advanced learning management system that allows for position-specific personalization (at the job duty level), captures individual differences in training efficiency and retention by training type (e.g., classroom-based, computer-based, scenario-based), and provides personalized recommendations using advanced biostatistical analysis techniques adapted from personalized medicine. \r\n\r\nThe current-state-of-the-art learning managements systems are largely focused on identifying training requirements by position. One issue with this level of personalization is that two people can hold the same position title within an organization, but their day-to-day job may involve supporting very different mission sets with distinct software and tasking. This means that a person might have to accomplish substantial training in areas that are not relevant to their position. The first objective of this topic is to develop a Learning Management System (LMS) that is personalized by mission and position. The system would have the capability to identify the software on a desktop and use this as one input to determine the optimal training pathway that is relevant for the position. This would enable a much finer level of granularity and an initially more narrowly focused training plan, leading acceleration of the acquisition of initial competencies required for their job. As an individual develops expertise, the training plan would increase the breadth. Throughout an individual\u0092s career, the LMS would track the development of knowledge, skills, and experiences. \r\n\r\nCurrent learning management systems being developed will track an individual\u0092s knowledge, skills, and experiences across their career and recommend additional training based on gaps. One gap with existing systems is that they fail to account for individual differences in learning efficacy and retention with different types of training. Future training will be a combination of classroom, computer, and scenario-based training. Research indicates that there are often substantial individual differences in training outcomes (e.g., Allen, Hays & Huffardi, 1986; Gully et al., 2002). Currently, if a competency is not met after a training session is completed, the LMS will recommend the student take the same training again, with minor differences, if any, to the training mode. While additional repetition alone can sometimes compensate for learning challenges in a particular area, changing the mode of training can offer larger training gains. Current systems do not offer this level of tracking or flexibility to provide prescriptive training recommendations taking into account individual learner propensities. \r\n\r\nThe challenge of providing personalized recommendations to address individual differences has been addressed in other fields, such as personalized medicine. In the area of personalized medicine, the concept is that the collection of metadata regarding an individual\u0092s profile, along with treatment outcomes, can not only improve the ability to make future treatment choices for that individual but can also improve the ability of doctors to identify which treatment options will be the most effective for similar patients. Researchers are using advanced statistical techniques to interpret the vast amounts of health data from genetic profiles to side effects experienced in order to provide recommendations. This kind of personalized care has already made significant gains in patient health. \r\n\r\nThe LMS to be developed here should leverage similar methodologies to identify the optimal training pathways based on the vast amount of data contained in military learning management systems (e.g., deployments, position data, prior training data) and provide training recommendations. It would contain data such as recency, organization, position, where the knowledge, skill, or experience (KSE) was acquired, and the category of KSE. The LMS would allow researchers and instructors to analyze the data to look at training questions such as skill decay for different training types (e.g., by comparing at recency of training versus competency level at refresh). This would eventually allow trainers and researchers to identify optimal training modes that maximize retention and allow for the development of personalized refresher training requirements. This would provide the data the Air Force needs to push past the standard annual training requirement and provide training that maximally supports developing our force. \r\n\r\nFinally, the system should track data in a way to allow for a cross-organizational analysis of knowledge, skills, and experiences. The system would aggregate training data and provide a repository which contains knowledge, skills, and experiences for positions across the Air Force. The repository would be flexible (i.e., allowing more fields to be added) and searchable. The database would give instructors the ability to perform cross-organizational analyses of experiences that would allow for the understanding of ways to apply existing training environments to new domains to facilitate the development of expertise in our warfighters. It would also aid the prioritization of funding for the development of new training environments to maximize the cross-domain utility. \r\n\r\nThe Phase I work should be focused on Command and Control, Computers, Communication and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) domains.

The Fowler-Nordheim relation, derived in 1927, for planar geometry, non-interacting electrons, and no accounting for electronic structure, represents our best understanding of field emission however with TD-DFT and DFT we can now move beyond this. Where field emission is desired (cathode in an HPM source) we seek materials and/or material configurations that will lower the voltage threshold for field emission and increase field emission current magnitude. Where emission is unwanted (an anode for an HPM source) we seek materials with high thresholds for electron stimulated desorption (ESD), field emission, secondary electron emission (SEE). These emission processes yield a plasma in the HPM source resulting in pulse shortening and thus degradation of HPM source operation.\r\n\r\nTD-DFT has recently been used to examine the phenomena of field emission from Carbon Nanotubes (CNT) resulting in the identification of adsorbates that significantly enhance field emission current. Potential Energy Surfaces (PES) used to describe the interaction between a surface and a molecule may be derived using DFT. The PES may then be used to determine forces acting on a molecule and thus describe the desorption process.

This validation will allow modeling to be used to optimize tDCS electrode design, scalp placement, intensity and electrode montage to enhance cognitive performance or efficacy of therapeutic treatments for a variety of neurological ailments.\r\n \r\nTranscranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to improve cognitive functions in healthy people such as attention, memory and learning (e.g., Reis et al., 2009; Grosbras & Paus, 2003; Ohn et al., 2008; Fl\u00f6el et al., 2008), and several reports within the Department of Defense have speculated about the possibility of using noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) for troop enhancement (Russell, Bulkley, & Grafton 2005; Nelson, 2007). Additionally, NIBS techniques have applications to the treatment of a variety of neurologic conditions such as major depressive disorder, stroke rehabilitation, traumatic brain injury, etc.  The tDCS technique modulates the neurons\u0092 resting membrane potential by passing a small electrical current (= 2 mA) between two electrodes placed on the scalp.  This passage of current then creates a net increase or decrease in excitability in targeted areas (Paulus, 2004; Priori, 2003).  This altered excitability leads to an increase or decrease in local brain activity which can alter human performance/behavior.  To be effective, tDCS must target the task-specific brain areas or networks.  Because the current pass through a variety of tissues to reach the cortex such as skin, skull, cerebral spinal fluid, and fat the electrical resulting current flow can be non-intuitive and often is dependent on regional tissue conductivity and anatomical features/structure.  Effectively, it is insufficient to select scalp locations directly over the brain region of interest due to the fact the current may flow in an unexpected manner.  In an effort to optimize electrode placement for targeting of specific brain areas and optimizing human performance or therapeutic treatment effects, tDCS current flow models have been developed (e.g., Datta, et al., 2009; McKinley, et al., 2013).  Unfortunately, there is currently no methodology of device to empirically validate these models due to the fact it would require measurement within the human brain.  Additionally, holes or cracks in the skull change the passage of current into the brain due to the fact that the skull has low conductivity.  By validating these models with a phantom skull, they could be used to identify optimal scalp locations, intensity, design, and montage for electrode placement for a variety of human performance enhancement and therapeutic treatment applications.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated the measured current range in the brain tissue is on the order of a few nano-amps up to 100 milli-amps, therefore, the phantom much be able to have suitable gain to measure in this range.

Traditional reactive computer network defense techniques have to constantly play \u0093catch-up\u0094 to an ever increasing array of cyber attacks being designed by our adversaries.

Of specific interest are cyber hardening and cyber agility techniques for avoiding cyber attacks which provide a strategic cyber advantage by reducing or eliminating the need to fight, increasing the cost, time, and difficulty to launch an attack, and reducing the probability of a successful attack.\r\n\r\nCyber hardening techniques reduce the extent of the exposed attack surface by eliminating vulnerabilities in networking protocols and services that may be exploited by adversaries to launch attacks. For instance, a network routing protocol that lacks authentication is vulnerable to spoofing attacks that can subvert the operation of the network. For this case, cyber hardening would involve incorporating the necessary protocol message authentication techniques.  Approaches for cyber hardening aerial IP networks that preserve existing investments in network infrastructure, e.g., tactical IP radios, are desirable to ones that require replacement of network equipment.\r\n\r\nCyber agility techniques avoid network attacks by performing evasive defensive maneuvers that present a \u0093moving target\u0094 to the adversary making it extremely difficult for the adversary to obtain a fix on the target for launching a successful attack.

This imparts momentum on the entire weapon system which is correspondingly reduced due to the penetration resistance of the target. Even for the rigid body (i.e., ignoring flexible body dynamics), the inertial deceleration forces can exceed 10,000 g''s (gravitational acceleration) and remain above that threshold over a long duration, often well in excess of 5 ms. Adding to the harshness of the environment is the multiaxial nature of the loading, which includes both bending and shear moments. The most extreme example is in \"tail slap,\" where large lateral accelerations are introduced due to the bending and rebound of the weapon in the lateral direction (i.e., perpendicular to the axis of penetration). Developing a controllable test method and predictive capability to apply this environment in testing is critical to the development of fuze, energetic, and other weapon technologies. However, the corresponding change in velocity typically requires ballistic or operational testing. Both testing methods are extremely costly, personnel intensive, and introduce both technical and safety risks. It is therefore desirable to develop a low-cost, reusable testing method (and accompanying experimental and simulation capabilities) that can reproduce acceleration/time profiles representative of penetration (amplitude for a duration, or equivalently the integrated velocity change) in opposing (shock-countershock) and multiple directions (multiaxial) for a sizable test article (threshold 10 lbs., objective 250 lbs.).\r\n\r\nPractical test considerations also impose additional requirements beyond the required multiaxial acceleration/duration performance. Most tests call for more sensor channels than are recordable in an onboard recording system. In these instances, a nearly-stationary (i.e., \u0093pseudo-static\u0094) test article is typically used.  An additional benefit is that off-board instrumentation is able to collect more channels of data with higher precision and sampling rates.

Noise regulations proposed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) over the last two decades have continued to require source reduction of noise emitted from commercial aircraft. Noise from military tactical aircraft continues to grow as the need for engines with higher thrust and lower fuel consumption drives turbine engine technology development. High noise exposure from aircraft operations is effectively constrained by compatible land uses in residential communities around military bases. Aircraft engine noise also has a more acute impact of potential hearing loss on airport ground crews, and military aircraft carrier launch/recovery crews.\r\n\r\nResearch is ongoing in the area of supersonic jet noise assessment and reduction. Several methods have been developed since the 1980 to identify specific jet noise sources in supersonic jets.  As a result, noise from round supersonic turbo fan engines is becoming well understood.  Novel three-stream architectures are currently under development in the DoD.  In these systems, a second fan stream, or third steam, is used to optimize the engine over many cycle points.  Three-stream engines have the potential for up to 25 percent fuel savings.  The independent third stream nozzle creates shock and turbulence interactions that are very different from round supersonic jets.  Future nozzles may also be rectangular instead of round.  Finally, the aircraft will have an integral aft deck with which the supersonic jet and third stream will interact.  Noise sources from these types of nozzles with these features are not well understood or well modeled.\r\n\r\nCurrently available noise models predict noise from subsonic and round supersonic two stream nozzles well.  These models, however, do not accurately predict noise from supersonic three-stream jets, from other than round configurations with three-streams, and from configurations with integral aft decks.

For example, aerodynamic data probes severely distort the down-stream airflow, greatly diminishing the utility of traditional wind tunnel force and moment measurement systems. A further complicating factor is that aerodynamic, propulsion, and structural parameters are closely intertwined for hypersonic systems. Therefore, the hole that is cut into a hot, thin structure (e.g., a wing) for a skin friction sensor will tangibly alter the aerothermal, mechanical, and acoustic response of the structure, and it will alter the response of the near-field air stream to the structural surface characteristics.\r\n\r\nHowever, validation of hypersonic technologies and flight system designs requires high-resolution measurement devices and methods that can obtain the level of detail necessary to validate high-fidelity computational tools.

Combustion instability typically arises because of complex physical coupling between the unsteady heat release and the resonant acoustic modes inside the engine. This thermoacoustic instability can produce large pressure fluctuations that can lead to reduced engine performance and severe structural damage. In modern gas-turbine augmentors, instability or screech/rumble modes evolve both spatially and temporally and typically occur in frequency ranges from hundreds to thousands of hertz. Since local heat\u0096release rates vary in a combustion process, various modes and degrees of thermoacoustic instabilities will be exhibited. Moreover, because of the complex physical and chemical reactions involved in thermoacoustic instabilities, these instabilities are difficult to predict.  Typically, the measured flame-transfer function between heat release fluctuation and equivalence ratio (i.e., fuel-air ratio) fluctuation is required as a direct input for a combustion instability model. Noninvasive laser-based measurement technologies capable of measuring heat-release rate (HRR) and fuel-air ratio (F/A) at multiple spatial points and at a data acquisition rate of 10 kHz or greater is required to address the combustion instability issues in gas\u0096turbine augmentors. In addition to these primary performance parameters (i.e., HRR, F/A), the secondary performance parameters of interest are velocity, temperature and concentration distribution of key combustion species such as OH, CH, CO and CO2. These parameters can provide information on local flame-front phenomena and interactions between turbulent flows and chemical reactions for screech mitigation technology development.\r\n\r\nThere exist short- and long-term needs to develop practical sensing tools that will enable researchers and manufacturers to capture local variations of heat release, fuel-air ratio, and other parameters of interest (i.e., velocity, temperature, species concentrations) as a function of time. This knowledge will help track the dominant mechanisms that lead to and help sustain combustion instabilities, impacting designs of new technology. Fundamental laboratory research and development efforts are required to develop and demonstrate laser-based sensor systems for two-dimensional (2D), high-speed measurements of HRR and quantitative F/A in augmentor systems.\r\n\r\nIt is highly desirable that the developed sensor systems are designed with an emphasis on robustness for challenging combustion rig environments and are appropriately packaged for integration into probe housings capable of measurements in combustion hot zones on the order of 2500K and with an overall diameter approximately 12 mm or less. The current state-of-the-art diagnostic approaches that provide spatially and temporally resolved local flowfield measurements involve free-standing optics, packaged in considerably larger diameters, or involve approaches that are not feasible for probe integration into realistic test rigs or engine test stands at Arnold Engineering Development Complex, Tenn., or OEMs. Exploring fiber-based measurements of HRR and F/A with the aim of transitioning these sensor systems to realistic gas-turbine engine test facilities is highly encouraged.

Currently the engagement modeling tool used for this purpose is the Joint RF Effects Model (JREM), which is a combination of the Radio Frequency Propagation and Target Effects Code (RF-PROTEC) and the Directed RF Energy Assessment Model (DREAM) [1].  Specifically, the target effects are calculated using the DREAM model, which is based on identifying ports of entry (POEs) whereby RF energy enters the target, identifying the critical susceptible components or subsystems and the associated failure modes and fault tree, and determining the path loss between each POE and the associated crucial component.  This last piece, the path loss, has severe limitation since it has to be provided as a user input, rather than being calculated, and the susceptibility calculated by DREAM is strongly dependent on the value of this parameter.\r\n\r\nThe original DREAM model, which will be available, was developed fifteen years ago and has been applied to many problems of interest to the Air Force.  In the intervening years, however, there has been significant progress in modeling and predicting effects on electronics.  New electromagnetic computational tools have been developed that make use of increased computer speed and increased storage, and hence large-scale simulations are routinely accomplished that were impossible fifteen years ago.  In addition, the area of RF effects on electronics has seen significant progress in the last ten years, both in the US and overseas [2].

In addition, there have been significant improvements in the area of network and failure mode modeling, which could potentially be incorporated in an updated model.

The labor-intensive and high-latency radio interference monitoring capabilities available such as the AFSCN Link Protection System (ALPS) and direction-finder antenna suites, in conjunction with human-in-the-loop decision support systems, make it impractical to detect and respond to elusive and adaptive radio threats.

This is caused by the specifics of military scenarios and by the fact that analysts spend about 80% of their time looking for the right data and only 20% analyzing the data. There is a need for machine learning methods that can assist the analysts in identifying additional candidates in unlabeled data for manual verification. \r\n\r\nImage processing algorithms extract large number of possibly redundant features which decrease classification accuracy and increase computational time. Reducing the number of features therefore is an important preprocessing step in machine learning. Feature extraction algorithms, such as PCA, LDA, and CCA, map the original feature space to a new feature space where the features are difficult to interpret. Feature selection algorithms preserve the original features and thus provide superior interpretability. These algorithms are, however, inefficient as their computational complexity is exponential in the number of features. Feature clustering methods reduce dimensionality while attempting to fully represent information important for classification and thus are a promising direction for efficiency and interpretability. Conventional feature clustering techniques perform poorly in the scenarios with small number of labeled samples. When number of training samples is small, the solution is to take into account unlabeled data, which is the case of semi-supervised feature selection. The objective functions utilized in feature clustering optimize the quality of clusters and are not directly related to the classification criterion.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this topic is to develop semi-supervised feature clustering methods when only a small number of positive training objects is available along with a large amount of unlabeled data.

The object and feature extraction algorithms will produce object description with a large number of features. The goal of the learning algorithm is to simultaneously identify objects that are similar to the training sample and to select features that optimize the similarity measure. The proposed methodology has to be compared to state of the art machine learning techniques and validated on electro-optical data such as MAMI-I data set recently collected by AFRL, CLIF dataset (EO/IR), ARCHER dataset (HSI) and possibly other similar datasets that are publically available.  \r\n\r\nThe desired technology should include algorithms for object detection and feature construction in multi-spectral still and motion imagery.

However, when using multiple assets, the handoff problem must be solved, meaning that when one platform is tracking an object of interest, the responsibility for tracking that object must be able to transition to another platform. Currently, this handoff is reliant on Global Positioning System (GPS), whether using location estimates of the moving target to determine whether two platforms are looking at the same target [1], or just using location estimates to know where two sensors should look to use appearance-based handoff. In either case, the problem will become far more difficult in a denied environment when GPS is not available.\r\n\r\nFor this topic, an approach for enabling handoff of a target between multiple agents without GPS should be developed and demonstrated.  This system should work whether handoff is between two sensors of the same modality (e.g., two color, electro-optical cameras) or of different modalities. For the purpose of this project, minimizing communication is not a high priority, but communication requirements should be realizable with current, low-cost systems (e.g., WiFi systems, or 1-2 Mbits/s communication channels.) Two significant components of a system that solves this problem will include:\r\n(1) Distributed computation of relative pose estimates. The pose (location and attitude) estimation routine should be decentralized and capable of using ranging and/or bearing measurements between agents to determine relative pose estimates. Magnetometers or similar sensors that provide some global information can be assumed, but systems providing global location estimates (GPS, LORAN, etc.) cannot be assumed.

While appearance-based approaches can be used to \"finalize\" a handoff, the problem of jointly deciding where to point a sensor that is not currently tracking an object to start the handoff process will need to be solved prior to appearance-based methods becoming applicable. In addition, for multiple modality cases, relative-pose based methods may be all that is available to enable handoff. Once the sensors are pointing at the same general area, deciding when a particular object has been identified by both agents must be done in a probabilistically reasonable fashion.\r\n\r\nEffectiveness of proposed approaches will be evaluated on how accurately relative pose can be computed in a distributed fashion.  In particular, the impact of relative pose errors on the probability of two sensors identifying the same target will need to be characterized.  In Phase I, this can be done using a simulation environment developed by the contractor.  Closed-form expressions for in-accuracies introduced by the relative-pose uncertainties can be validated by these simulations.

The telephone, which started out as a non-portable analog device, has become one of the most common digital computing systems in use with the development of the smartphone. Digital computers have dominated the market over analog computers due to speed, size, cost, etc. However, while digital processing offers many advantages over analog processing, analog devices cannot be eliminated completely. One major area still dominated by analog is data transmission. Data is commonly transmitted and received over radio frequency (RF) waves. This includes modern telephone systems, radio broadcasts, military devices such as RADARs, satellite communications, etc. While the data being processed inside each of these is digital, the data coming in and going out is still analog.\r\n\r\nIn order for analog data to be digitally processed or for digital data to be broadcast over an analog wave, there must be bridges between analog and digital. These bridges consist of Analog to Digital Converters (ADC) and Digital to Analog Converters (DAC). As technology has progressed, the need for ADCs and DACs with higher resolutions, better Signal to Noise Ratios (SNR), and faster sampling rates has greatly increased. Also, with the development of smaller, portable devices, the size, weight and power of these ADCs and DACs needs to be reduced.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this topic is the DAC for space applications. Current RH DACs have about 12 bit resolution, and operate in the Mega-Samples per Second (MSPS) range. Commercial DACs (Non-RH) can have 16 bit resolutions while operating in the GSPS range. There is a need for good resolution (at least 12 bits), high speed (at least 2GSPS), RH DACs to support new satellite developments. These DACs must balance the tradeoffs between speed, resolution, noise, and SWaP.

These gaps are filled with a polymeric material that cracks allowing water to wick into the interface forming a galvanic couple.  Current inspections remove the surface layer to inspect the underlying structure.  While effective, this method is very time consuming and costly.

These systems sense airframe attitude, through measurement of the relative angular position of known celestial objects, and position, if a reference frame relative to the local horizontal can be inferred. Since these systems directly impact accuracy of closed-loop guidance, a capability to test them as an integral part of the guidance system, i.e., hardware-in-the-loop simulation, is desired. Development of advanced star trackers for use in manned aircraft, remotely piloted aircraft (RPAs) and weapons will require a hardware-in-the-loop capability to integrate, test, and calibrate the system on the ground. This technology could also be used to support commercial interests, such as testing trackers for use in commercial maritime, aviation, and space navigation applications.\r\n\r\nA number of challenges exist that exceed the capability of current hardware-in-the-loop simulators.  Optical representation of star maps with radiometric accuracy is required in the visible through the short wave infrared spectrum. Collimated representation of the star field is required to sub-microradian accuracy. These advancements will require innovative solutions to extend scene generation capabilities to shorter wavelengths with increased contrast (greater than 2000:1).\r\n\r\nCapability is needed to represent the sky and stellar background including for a wide range of day and night celestial objects, backgrounds and optical distortions.  Representation of atmospheric objects (clouds, aerosols, etc.) and scatter along with possible interference of earth/sea glint and earth limb must also be considered. It is also a goal to provide radiometrically adjustable targets.  In other words, it would be nice to have the ability to accurately simulate star color in the scene generator.\r\n\r\nThese advancements will require innovative solutions to extend scene generation capabilities to shorter wavelengths with increased contrast (much greater than 2000:1), represent point source angular position to higher accuracy (about 100 urad) over a large field of view (greater than 20 degrees), and to represent a broad spectrum of airframe motion to navigation accuracy (greater than 400 deg/sec). Dynamic representation of stellar objects including Sun (V.M. -26), Moon, stars and space objects ranging from Magnitude 15 to Mag  -4+ are needed.  The need for objects with static magnitudes and temporally modulated magnitudes is also anticipated.\r\n\r\nInnovative solutions are being sought that will allow the insertion of celestial navigation systems, including associated inertial measurement units, into a hardware-in-the-loop test environment. While complete solution concepts are strongly encouraged and will be given priority, partial capabilities that describe one or more of the identified challenges will also be considered. Anticipated solutions range from complete environmental simulation using hardware simulators, to full or partial digital injection capabilities if hardware solutions are unreasonable.\r\n\r\nDynamics of the platforms under consideration deviate in major ways from traditional stellar inertial instrument application for attitude control on stable satellite platforms.  A star tracker for use in manned aircraft, RPAs and weapons will require a much more robust dynamic environment for targets and backgrounds due to the missile and aircraft high G dynamics and severe flight vibrations to be replicated during star tracker testing. Some instrument concepts under consideration require stimulation of the star field at up to 800 frames per seconds to reduce air frame vibration effects at high Mach number.\r\n\r\nThe approach should represent point source angular position to higher accuracy (less than 100 microradians) over a large field of view (greater than 20 degrees), and to represent a broad spectrum of airframe motion to navigation accuracy. Goals include to provide image motion rates of more than 400 deg/second in a random direction to represent actual flight dynamics of an airborne missile platform.  The number and type of targets to be projected or simulated and the approach for quasistatic and dynamic stellar objects must be addressed to provide a representative number of objects in the stellar instrument field of view.\r\n\r\nOther considerations include angular static accuracy measurement.

Historically, multi-criteria utility value function analyses have been accomplished through an analytic process where independent \u0093cost\u0094 and \u0093effectiveness\u0094 analyses are conducted and the results combined to provide some level of \u0093cost-effectiveness\u0094 insights.  The Combat Forces Assessment Model (CFAM) and STORM are two examples of useful analytic tools built for specific purposes.  CFAM\u0092s optimization problem can be formulated with alternative objective functions and constraint sets, but a typical problem is to determine the mix of munitions required to maximize the value of targets destroyed given a set of prioritized targets (by distance band and time phase) while minimizing the cost (munition and aircraft losses) of the campaign.  Although CFAM has been successfully applied to the Air Force\u0092s Nonnuclear Consumables Annual Analysis (NCAA) process, it has several limitations:  it is a one-sided, air-only linear formulation of the cost optimization problem; the set of prioritized targets (often generated from STORM-based campaign analysis outcomes) must be provided as input; and it does not directly represent the effect of ISR on the air planning and execution processes.  CFAM does not explicitly consider the operational context nor represent the inherent risk associated with countering an adaptive adversary\u0092s forces, capabilities and actions, thus limiting the cost-effectiveness insights available from the tool.\r\n\r\nOn the other end of the cost-effectiveness analytic question continuum is STORM, a campaign-level, perception-based analytic tool used by the U.S Air Force and Joint analytic communities.  STORM explicitly represents U.S. and enemy air, space, ground and naval weapons, platforms and entities; and is used to provide effectiveness insights on the contribution of their combat and support capabilities to the campaign outcome, for both U.S. and adversary forces.  The planning and execution processes dynamically react as the campaign unfolds with campaign, perception-based results (e.g., AAR support missions canceled, strike aircraft killed in the air or on the ground, air defense sites survive the A2S attack, etc.).  STORM\u0092s air planning processes interact with, affect, and are affected by other warfare functionality areas (logistics, mobility, communications, ISR/sensors, etc.), and any modifications to the air strike planning process would need to account for those relationships and dependencies.  Similarly, STORM\u0092s planning processes were designed with no consideration of cost in either the value functions or input data driving the process outcomes.  This can best be illustrated by discussing the current air strike planning process.  The user provides as input a prioritized target set as well as available air-to-surface munitions based on scenario requirements and National Command Authority/COCOM priorities.  Given air asset and air-to-surface munition availability, STORM\u0092s air strike planning process uses a target-centric, greedy heuristic to select aircraft and weapons to strike the highest priority target (representing the warfighter\u0092s strategic intent) as soon as possible, considering only if the squadron (aircraft, munition with the highest expected yield) can satisfy the target\u0092s damage requirements (with no consideration of the munition/fuel costs or the cost of expected aircraft losses).\r\n\r\nBottom-line.  This SBIR is to determine if the two aspects of a cost-informed operational effectiveness weapons analysis, previously handled separately as part of an analytic process, can be incorporated into a single tool to generate benefit-effectiveness insights that inform both the warfighters\u0092 and acquirers\u0092 decision space.", "objective": "Research and develop an air strike planning methodology/algorithm developed and integrated into the Theater Operations Research Model (STORM) that optimizes the assignment of air packages to targets based on a multi-criteria utility value function.", "topic_number": "AF151-111", "proposals_end_date": "2015-02-18T05:00:00Z", "pre_release_date": "2014-12-12T05:00:00Z"}, "pk": 114}, {"model": "sbirez.topic", "fields": {"program": "SBIR", "proposals_begin_date": "2015-01-15T05:00:00Z", "agency": "AirForce", "solicitation_id": "DoD SBIR 2015.1", "title": "Ephemeral Security Overlay for GPS", "saved_by": [], "url": "http://www.dodsbir.net/sitis/display_topic.asp?Bookmark=46383", "description": "Military GPS receivers are unlike any other cryptography-based system in the Department of Defense (DoD).

Competitive methods often need to be flexible enough to accommodate changes in a scene due to, for instance, illumination changes that can occur throughout the day, or location changes where the application is being implemented. Given the importance of this task, a variety of iterative techniques and methods have already been developed in order to perform background/foreground separation. However, they often rely on optimization routines that are computationally expensive, thus compromising their ability to do real time computations with limited resources.  New methods being developed must circumvent this prohibitively expensive computation to produce an exceptionally robust, efficient, and potentially game changing technologically, providing a foreground/background separation solution that is two- to three-orders faster than current methods. At such speeds, the algorithm can be very easily implemented on mobile platforms such as smartphones, thus making for a portable field device that can execute such tasks on a mobile phone application type of computing structure. Additionally, a number of technological innovations that can further increase efficiency by determining a small number of pixel locations that are maximally informative about the foreground actions in video streams would make identification and processing of information (for surveillance or gaming applications) even more efficient.", "objective": "The objective is to conceive algorithms that confer the ability to separate video frames into background and foreground components in real time on mobile computing platforms and other limited computational resource devices.", "topic_number": "AF151-001", "proposals_end_date": "2015-02-18T05:00:00Z", "pre_release_date": "2014-12-12T05:00:00Z"}, "pk": 119}, {"model": "sbirez.topic", "fields": {"program": "SBIR", "proposals_begin_date": "2015-01-15T05:00:00Z", "agency": "AirForce", "solicitation_id": "DoD SBIR 2015.1", "title": "On-Aircraft Cloud-Based App to Provide Enhanced EO/IR/SAR/Radar Sensor Exploitation", "saved_by": [], "url": "http://www.dodsbir.net/sitis/display_topic.asp?Bookmark=46352", "description": "Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have grave limitations in the quantity and quality of data that can be transmitted either for end use or exploitation.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR effort seeks to develop and deploy one or more applications (Apps), similar in concept to those hosted on smart phones and within ground-based clouds, which can access this collected data, process it and then exploit the results using existing or newly developed algorithms.

However, the most successful assailants rely heavily on the reconnaissance stages, which are primarily divided as passive or active approaches [1]. Passive reconnaissance is a mere collection of information using search engines or various other methods in obtaining publicly available information. This form of information gathering requires entities to practice discretionary posting of information and is often a disregarded tactic used by sophisticated criminals today. The active reconnaissance approach generally results in the act of probing and scanning hosts or servers to determine IP addresses, database information, operating systems used, passwords, usernames, etc. While defensive tactics such as monitoring traffic flow with intrusion detection systems (IDS) or stateful firewalls can help detect active reconnaissance practices, attackers are still able to administer stealthier techniques, such as sending smaller amounts of packets to avoid detection. Since reconnaissance is generally the preceding stage in an attempt to compromise a system, attackers can successfully perform a multitude of attacks on target systems using the gathered information.   As such, increasing the effort required on the part of the adversary to obtain actionable intelligence, or providing inaccurate information altogether can enhance the overall security posture of a system or network [2].\r\n\r\nThere is a need for secure, infrastructure agnostic, solutions designed for cyber agility and anti-reconnaissance.

Currently all OMC components are inspected by NDE for defects before service and frequently during service as well.  Available NDE techniques and data analyses are very capable of detecting defects in flat plate geometries. However, these methods and analysis tools have difficulty inspecting across the apex of curved parts like leading edges and airfoils while maintaining the required sensitivity to defects.  Incremental improvements to current methods are not being sought.  The intent of this solicitation is to address a very complex inspection requirement that has not been resolved by incremental engineering of the standard five methods (ultrasound, eddy current, radiography, magnetic particle and fluorescent penetrant).  However, it is possible that the potential solution could be based on these methods.

Further, particulate matter (PM) and chemicals are released during various aerospace processes, such as jet fuel combustion and practices where materials are burned or detonated. The toxicity of individual NMs, incidental PM and chemical species, in addition to particulate/chemical mixtures are critical to understand for both protecting military personnel and advancing aerospace technologies. Currently, standard in vitro models do not represent the complexity of in vivo conditions [2,3]. Due to the requirement to replace in vivo models to address high cost and ethical concerns, dynamic in vitro models incorporating shear flow and mechanical flexure simulating whole organs are critical. Progress has been made towards this end, such as the development of the lung-on-a-chip model [4]. Advantages of this model is that the chip is optically transparent, allowing for cellular imaging-based endpoints, and has a high elasticity, allowing for mechanical flexure to simulate breathing. There are also drawbacks to the current organ-on-a-chip models. They are limited by traditional fabrication approaches and polymer properties. The polymer commonly used to fabricate the chips, polydimethylsiloxane, suffers from chemical incompatibility. For example, it swells when exposed to chemicals of key concern in aerospace applications, such as hexane and toluene [5]. Therefore, further developments are required in order to improve the complexity of in vitro investigations to support aerospace toxicology. The membrane thickness using traditional organ-on-a-chip approaches does not closely mimic many in vivo membranes. One models of top interest for aerospace toxicology is the blood air barrier in the pulmonary region of the lung. The membrane thickness of the basement membrane in the blood gas barrier is on the order of 0.05 microns, and the thickness of the blood gas barrier in the human lung is 0.2 microns [6]. However, elastic membranes demonstrated in published organ-on-a-chip models are limited to about 10 microns [4]. In addition to thickness, the surface area of the membrane should also be sufficient to allow for enough cells to be grown while remaining within the limits for typical biochemical assays (= 0.2 cm2).

The high speed systems may be expendable or reusable which places different requirements on the M&P selection. Temperatures can range from 1100 degrees F to 3500 degrees F depending on the vehicle and the location on the vehicle. This requires materials like titanium alloys, superalloys, ceramics and ceramic matrix composites (CMC). Making the wrong selection will increase risk, cost and impact system performance.

An ideal system would have bandwidth large enough to replace multiple systems covering different frequency ranges and would reduce the size, weight and power (SWaP) requirements for operation on mobile platforms. Sensors built from high temperature superconducting (HTS) electronics may be able to fill both of these requirements for realization of this need. A Josephson junction is the active element of superconducting electronics formed by two superconducting electrodes separated by a thin normal metal or insulating barrier. When a phase difference exists across the barrier, a super current will flow in the absence of a voltage where the critical current is the maximum super current sustainable by the barrier. The critical current of a Josephson junction is a function of magnetic field IC(B)= IC |Sinc BA/f0| where A is the area of the junction and f0 is the flux quantum. This effect may be used to detect magnetic field by DC biasing the junction above the critical current and by measuring the resulting voltage. A sensor using a single junction was demonstrated with a voltage to magnetic field response of 50 V/T over a range of about 10 \u00b5T. 50 V/T is very modest in comparison to interferometers built from two junctions connected in parallel called SQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference devices). SQUIDs typically achieve 105 V/T [2] and therefore have traditionally been assumed to be the magnetic field detector of choice. However the dynamic range of the SQUID is limited to about 10 nT in comparison to 10 \u00b5T for single junctions. Furthermore, the SQUID transfer function is very non-linear so to utilize it as a detector it is typically connected to feedback electronics that limit the bandwidth to a few MHz [2]. Using arrays of very large numbers of nano Josephson junctions will increase the output voltage and therefore sensitivity. The best Josephson junctions for this are nano Josepshon junctions fabricated with ion beam damage [3] because unlike other HTS junction technologies they can be very closely spaced (~150 nm) [4,5], positioned anywhere on a substrate and have excellent temporal stability [6]. Consider a 1 cm chip consisting of a series array of nano Josephson junctions in a meander line. Modestly estimating 400 meanders (25 micron periodicity) with an inter-junction spacing of 0.5 microns yields a total of 8 x 106 Junctions. Assuming a typical single junction ICR product of 10 \u00b5V and 50 percent modulation of the critical current to zero this yields 40 V! If only 25 percent of this signal had a usable linear range it would still yield 10 V/10 \u00b5T or equivalently 106 V/T which is an order of magnitude better than a SQUID with the added benefits of a large dynamic range, high-linearity and wide-bandwidth.", "objective": "Develop a wide-bandwidth receiver utilizing series arrays of high-transition-temperature superconducting (HTS) nano Josephson junctions.", "topic_number": "AF151-002", "proposals_end_date": "2015-02-18T05:00:00Z", "pre_release_date": "2014-12-12T05:00:00Z"}, "pk": 128}, {"model": "sbirez.topic", "fields": {"program": "SBIR", "proposals_begin_date": "2015-01-15T05:00:00Z", "agency": "AirForce", "solicitation_id": "DoD SBIR 2015.1", "title": "Mediated Mobile Access (MMA)", "saved_by": [], "url": "http://www.dodsbir.net/sitis/display_topic.asp?Bookmark=46351", "description": "Mobile devices facilitate access to controlled resources from potentially unsecured environments.

Coupled with the size of the imaging spectrometer, this cooling requirement can result in size, weight, and power (SWAP) demands that preclude the insertion of LWIR imaging spectrometry into practical systems, especially those intending to be deployed within gimbaled systems and on small airborne platforms.

While turbine performance increases are achievable through increases in turbine inlet temperature, this often results in decreased turbine durability. Since designers currently rely primarily on an experience-based approach, there is a durability margin that is built into the design of turbine components (for example, blades and vanes). Consequently, component life estimates can be either over-predicted or under-predicted. If part life is greater than predicted, then turbine components are using more than the optimum amount of cooling, and the performance of the overall system is reduced concomitantly. However, if part life is less than predicted, then the system requires more frequent inspection coupled with possible repairs and/or part replacements. This inevitably results in increased life-cycle costs as well as reduced readiness of the armed forces. Further, turbine components are subjected to exceptionally harsh thermal environments, and the present durability design and analysis capabilities used at original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are not sufficient to allow for accurate predictions of component life early in the design cycle. Consequently, major Air Force engine programs may be subject to durability problems, including burning, thermomechanical fatigue, and creep of turbine components.\r\n\r\nFurther to the above, the next generation of military aircraft have a need for lower thrust-specific fuel consumption (TSFC) and higher power-to-weight ratio than current, state-of-the-art turbine systems, and this is consistent with the Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engine (VAATE) program Phase III goals. Increasing turbine durability and/or reducing the durability margin designed into gas turbine components can have a substantial impact in that regard.

Design of an effective control system will require understanding of the system response to associated uncertainties. Uncertainties can come in the form of unpredictable aerodynamic forces and errors in onboard guidance and navigation sensors. Currently, the multi-disciplinary coupling of aerodynamics, thermal dynamics, structural dynamics, and material sciences are not well understood. This is particularly true of their accumulated impacts when traveling through many flight regimes. The impracticality of conducting ground-based experiments that can address characterization of these issues compounds the problem.     \r\n\r\nWhile the aeroelastic and control problems in every flight regime are important, most previous research efforts have had limited consideration. For systems operating at very high altitudes there has been considerable work performed, such as for re-entry and information, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) vehicles. However, there are still many knowledge gaps that warrant further study. In particular, many previous efforts have been restricted to limited operating conditions or to simplistic geometries (i.e., airfoils, panels, etc.). There exists no literature documenting the investigation of aeroelastic and control problems on high speed vehicles operating at terminal flight conditions subjected to the extreme structural and thermal loads experienced at high dynamic pressures. This is a niche that has been unique to the weapons community, whose systems are desired to operate in these extreme environments. This topic is motivated by these knowledge gaps and focuses on reduced-order modeling (ROM) of the relevant multi-physics associated with evolving FTSI effects for deforming high speed structures subjected to extreme environmental conditions, such as those encountered during the high speed terminal portion of weapons engagement. An example would be terminal guidance of an air-breathing airframe, beginning with long duration flight above Mach 5 and diving from above 70 kft to the earth's surface.\r\n\r\nThe state-of-the-art in prediction of these influences includes high-fidelity prediction techniques such as finite element and finite difference models that are computationally demanding. Uncoupled, reduced-order models are also available for structural dynamics that reconstruct the forced airframe response from an orthogonal eigenvector basis directly taken from a finite element analysis of modal response. This modal superposition approach is extremely efficient, allowing real-time simulation of hundreds of modes, but has not been demonstrated coupled to aerodynamic and thermal predictions in a closed-loop weapon simulation environment. Thermal predictions may have the most significant effect on structural deformation and therefore aerodynamics, but an effective approach involving a reduced order orthonormal basis is not apparent.

For a variety of reasons, the pulsed power driver is often one of the largest components in a directed energy system, and so there have been a number of efforts in recent years devoted to shrinking their size.  A key component of the driver with which to contend is the insulating structure, or bushing, around its output terminal, which also serves as an interface between the driver environment and that of the load it is driving (e.g., the driver may be immersed in oil or a high-pressure insulating gas, while in most cases the load is under vacuum).  Such loads may include high power microwave (HPM) sources, particle accelerators, or other vacuum electronic devices.\r\n\r\nHigh voltage vacuum insulators in general have been a topic of research for many decades, as they are used in many scientific and engineering applications.  The design of such insulators is complicated by the fact that electrical breakdown can be induced across the insulator surface by more than one mechanism [1, 2], each of which must be mitigated to allow the voltage capabilities of the insulator to be increased.  Increasing insulator size to enable greater electrode separation reduces the field stresses on the insulator and most often mitigates the breakdown problem, however doing so runs counter to efforts aimed at reducing overall system size.  It therefore is necessary to engineer the geometry of the insulator, including positions of triple points, and to carefully choose the insulator material composition so as to both maintain compact size and suppress the growth of breakdown mechanisms that are present with high electric field stresses.\r\n\r\nTo remain on the forefront of compact pulsed power driver development, the Air Force Research Laboratory desires to push the state of the art of high voltage insulators such that greater field stresses can be placed across smaller coaxial insulators for longer pulse durations.  Recent publications describing the state of the art for insulator development report field stresses of ~300 kV/cm being sustained for 100 nanoseconds across small samples (0.5\u00961.0 cm) of high gradient layered insulators [3]; these field stresses are several times the threshold for surface breakdown across conventionally designed insulators (50 kV/cm [4]).  We have an interest in exploring the feasibility of further increasing sustained field stresses by at least 50 percent (to 450 kV/cm) above these reported values, across insulators having operationally relevant sizes (several cm), for this same time scale and/or of increasing the duration of the applied fields by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude (to microseconds or 10s of microseconds) while still avoiding breakdown.\r\n\r\nTo accommodate the coaxial electrode arrangement, the insulator may be either radially or axially oriented, or some variant in between.  The first provides the most compact arrangement but has the highest field stresses (located where the center electrode passes through the insulator); the second can can provide a more uniform field distribution across the insulator with possibly greater distances between the high voltage and ground than in the radial orientation but at the cost of an increased volume required for the insulator.

These coatings can be applied by themselves or in combination on different locations of the same component.  During the normal depot component inspection the coatings must often be removed prior to inspection of the base material.  If the component passes the inspection, it must be recoated to be put back into service.  For high value parts, this procedure is performed often.  For low value parts, it is usually more cost effective to scrap the part and purchase new since the cost to strip-inspect-recoat exceeds the 70 percent threshold of the cost of a new part.  In both cases it is desiresable to have a whole-field inspection capability to inspect the component without removal of the coating regardless of the size and geometric complexity of the component.

Such data includes but is not limited to location specific process parameter values, material property target values, scan paths, process data collected during the fabrication process, and post build material characterization outputs.  Such data is useful for a range of activities including process design and evaluation, AM process model calibration and validation, and possibly qualification.\r\n\r\nThere are many existing Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools with capabilities for geometry definition, manipulation, and evaluation. While some attempts have been made to integrate AM workflows into existing CAD paradigms [1], in general existing CAD tools are not AM \"process aware\" and do not have the capability to manage the necessary spatially varying process data. The Additive Manufacturing Format (AMF) recently defined by ASTM [2] provides more advanced capabilities than the traditional STL format, but is primarily focused on geometry definition and has limited support for spatially varying process data. Equipment specific proprietary AM process planning software is employed to specify process parameters and to create scan paths based on geometry input from a CAD file (often in the STL format).

Electro-optic modulators are critical devices within high bandwidth analog optical systems, such as the photonic links connecting remote antenna stations on an aircraft to central processors.  It is widely acknowledged that electro-optic modulators are key components with regard to increasing performance of electronic warfare receivers or other analog applications onboard aircraft. While optical processing is one of the strengths offered by rf photonic technology, it can be limited by the ability to process optical materials with high quality and precision for insertion into devices. Here we seek to develop processing of nonlinear optical materials for the purposes of extending the capabilities of an important device for rf photonics, the electro-optic modulator.\r\n\r\nPrevious efforts on optically engineered electro-optic modulators have targeted increasing sensitivity through slow light effects or resonant cavities.These modulators are for example created by fabricating photonic crystals, Bragg gratings, or ring cavities within the modulator. There are also results that have used post modulation optical filtering to achieve more linear responses, however they are fundamentally limited since it is not possible to post filter the third-order or second-order distortions that are already within the passband. It is therefore desirable to develop high quality nanostructured materials for the purpose of both linearization and increasing the sensitivity of electro-optic modulators. There is a fundamental difference between optical filtering of the modulated light after it exits the modulator, and having the modulator itself be comprised of a nanostructured material since the nonlinear mixing process is changed by that latter but not the former.\r\n\r\nThis solicitation is not targeting slow light enhancements, the goal is controlled in-situ optical filtering within traveling wave modulators. Therefore useful optical responses must be well controlled and be able to filter down to the 5GHz range if possible, with the sharper filtering effect being better. For instance, a Lithium Niobate modulator that is also has an optical passband including only the optical fundamental minus 50 GHz is a useful configuration. It should also be noted that the filtering may alter the light wave velocity and therefore the traveling wave configuration of the rf electrodes will likely have to be engineered to match. For this effort, the optical fundamental wavelength is 1.55 microns, meaning that fabrication will need approximately 300-400nm feature sizes to be able to replicate modeled designs.

Light weight, low cost, small form factor, minimum power solutions are needed that may be integrated with existing aircraft systems to minimize impacts to current aircraft configurations.\r\n\r\nPrecision location of threats is required in order to effect neutralization through onboard countermeasures. The sensor system will have the ability to detect muzzle flash and rapidly provide geo-location, allowing the non-lethal neutralization of the threat. Additionally the system will have the ability to actively detect optically sighted systems, geo-locate, and provide a non-lethal countermeasure prior to the weapon being fired. Threat geo-location and direction of fire solely for the purpose of evasion are not of interest. The system should be able to detect and neutralize multiple threats simultaneously. The sensor is desired to be able to detect and discriminate small arms fire at altitudes up to and beyond 10000 feet.  It is desired that the sensor system be able to detect and discriminate larger munitions such as rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), mortars, AAA (anti-aircraft guns), and surface-to-air missiles (SAM) at altitudes up to 35000 feet.  It is highly desirable that the system provide non-imaging and imaging levels of capability with non-cryogenically sensor systems.  There are currently no non-cryogenic, low-cost hostile fire systems which are successfully fielded for this effort.\r\n\r\nPrevious sensor have been developed and tested for lower altitude unmanned air systems (UAS) but are large, expensive and lower sensitivity than needed for high altitude UAS operation. Previous approaches have also been subject to glint false alarms and unable to accurately discriminate type of event or friendly vs enemy fire. Basic sensing technologies and signal processing algorithms and subsystems have reduced size, weight, and power (SWaP) required for a hostile fire detection sensor to within the capabilities of many current and near-term remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) platforms to perform this mission. RPAs are becoming the primary platforms for persistent battlefield surveillance and the requirement for extended time on station determines to a great extent the available weight allocation for any hostile fire sensor system. Future RPA hostile fire sensors systems will take the form of Line Replaceable Units for legacy sensor payloads currently in use on the RPA fleet. Therefore, the size, weight, and power consumption of hostile fire sensor systems must emulate that of previous generation sensor systems without hostile fire sensing capabilities. Sensor system and processor must operate with minimal operator interaction.  System must be light weight, low drag, and suitable for CV-22 helicopter, MQ1/9 and C-130 flight environments.\r\n\r\nThe hostile fire sensor system must demonstrate the capability to operate with both low false alarm rates and relatively high probability of detection under operational conditions. The additional capability to perform threat geolocation in support of not only direct attack, but indirect attack, necessitate a close coupling between the sensor system and some form of inertial measurement capability either integral to the sensor or available as part of the mission flight package for the aerial platform. Determine the feasibility of meeting various sensor performance metrics using trade-space analysis from sensor component characteristics and available field measurements of weapon signatures.\r\n\r\nThe determination of military utility of a hostile fire sensor will be heavily dependent on its capacity to distinguish between friendly and hostile fire in order to avoid fratricide. There are different levels of fidelity currently defined for hostile fire sensor systems. Most systems currently differentiate among weapon classes, but lack a significant capability to confidently declare a weapon type within a class. \r\nThe goal is to design a sensor system prototype system to be integrated onto a test platform for the purpose of verification of sensor capabilities under live fire test conditions. Perform modeling and analysis to show the efficacy of the approach for different classes of threat systems. The Phase I prototype design will, potentially be heavier and less capable than an operational sensor, but the design should address traceability between demonstrable SWaP and performance for the captive carry prototype and an ultimate operational configuration for the hostile fire sensor.

The typical military aerospace environmental conditions create potential for fiber optic link degradation or failure. A poor quality or failing link has immediate & limiting impact to the platforms ability to accomplish the mission. Diagnostics & repair often take extensive amount of time and manpower. Typical fiber links lack systems for monitoring the fiber cable plant for degradation or faults due to connector contamination or damaged optical pathways.\r\n\r\nFiber optic systems with integrated methods of monitoring the cable plant and precisely locating faults have significant potential to reduce the total cost of ownership and improve the availability of the fiber networks over the asset life cycle.

Accommodating these new fuels with existing fuel system technology may cause performance differences in an engine. For example, recent work has illustrated that different candidate drop-in fuels can have slightly different physical properties as well as different chemical composition compared to the baseline JP-8 fuel. At some level, the differences, while seemingly small, may give rise to operability issues, under some conditions. For example, differences in lean blow-off, luminosity, and emissions have been noted. A particularly challenging application for these fuels is their use in combustion systems that may be prone to acoustic oscillations. In these devices, such as augmentors, the fuel is often injected as a liquid jet into a cross flow. As a result, fuel property differences can change jet penetration and droplet dispersion and can give rise to operability differences. Recent work has shown that JP-8 spec fuel derived from different feedstocks can exhibit differences in jet penetration and breakup characteristics. Other work has illustrated the sensitivity of spray behavior (for a fixed fuel) to changes in injector discharge coefficient.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is hypothesized that an interaction in fuel properties and injector internal geometry could be the key to 1) explaining observed differences among the behavior of the fuels and 2) identifying effective strategies to mitigate any differences due to fuel type.  If the fuel injection schemes differ for each fuel, then this dictates efforts to design and develop fuel injectors for each fuel, which is cost prohibitive. Thus, it is essential to have fuel-type-tolerant injectors, so that a huge amount of resources can be saved from retrofitting different classes of injectors to accommodate different liquid fuels for combustion systems.\r\n\r\nWhat is desired in this effort is an injector design, or injection strategy, that is inherently insensitive to liquid fuel properties. JP-8 fuel should be used as a baseline to which other alternative fuels can be compared. The alternative fuels used should meet the JP-8 spec but can be derived from alcohol-to-jet (ATJ), hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), and/or the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process. A mixture of alternative fuels and JP-8 is also acceptable. New ideas should be analyzed and/or tested by comparing the spray properties (SMD, droplet distribution,etc.) of JP-8 to the alternative fuels.  For an augmentor application, test conditions can range from 100 to 300 psi for the fuel spray entering into a cross flow of 0.5 to 3.0 atm. The temperature range of the cross flow is from 100 degrees F to 1700 degrees F, although testing at high temperatures is not necessary for a Phase I effort.\r\n\r\nConsideration for retrofit applications as well as incorporation into future concepts should be given for any idea proposed.\r\n\r\nThis is a DoD-wide issue as non-fossil-derived fuels become more common.\r\n\r\nPartnership and/or teaming with engine OEMs are highly recommended.", "objective": "Develop an injection strategy that is insensitive to liquid fuel properties.

Power amplifier efficiency translates to the terminal\u0092s DC power consumption requirements, as well as additional hardware/structures to address corresponding cooling requirements.  Reductions in the size, weight and power (SWaP) are critical to lowering ground terminal power consumption, footprint and cost.  Innovative linear-efficient circuit techniques, in combination with high-performance power technologies, have the potential of producing linear-efficient SSPAs to meet this low-cost terminal need.  Improved power amplifier efficiency may be achieved with solid-state power technologies such as gallium nitride (GaN), while linear-efficiency may be addressed with techniques such as envelope tracking.

Turbulence-induced scintillation losses are also greatly diminished at the longer wavelengths, thus reducing or eliminating the need for wave-front correction and other techniques required to overcome this additional problem. Recent increased demand for moderate to long range communications at extremely high data rates, and the growing lack of available RF bandwidth has resulted in the deployment of several new SWIR based systems, and has generated renewed interest in the LWIR spectrum to provide higher link availability in reduced atmospheric visibility conditions. Fortuitously, new component developments in the LWIR spectrum are now, for the first time, enabling practical implementations of communications systems operating at these wavelengths. The most dramatic and impressive of these has been in the area of Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL) sources. Compact, multi-watt QCL lasers, which can be directly modulated at GHz rates, are now available off-the-shelf.  These devices provide essentially the same Size, Weight, and Power (SWAP) advantages and functional capability as their SWIR laser diode and ER-fiber amplifier counterparts, but in the LWIR spectrum. Much technological progress has also been made on the receiver/detector side as well, but there is still a performance gap between the best LWIR and SWIR detector technologies in the general area of detector sensitivity, with the latter having an average advantage of 10 dB or more (maximum D* for  LWIR approx 1013,  maximum D* for SWIR >1014). Even with this receiver sensitivity limitation, operation in the LWIR spectrum offers a tremendous potential system advantage since even a slight degradation in atmospheric visibility can result in additional path losses of greater than 2 to 3 dB/Km in the SWIR spectrum. A number of new LWIR detector technologies have been explored and developed over the last few decades, including QWIP, Quantum Dots, and other variants of these. However, simpler bulk devices utilizing the older MCT technologies still provide the highest performance to date. (This is not to say that examination of the other technologies should be excluded, since the goal of this effort is to provide for the best possible near term solution in any form.) The most interesting new development of which we are aware appears to be the Electron Avalanche Photodiode (EAPD). These devices are reported to have the unique ability to provide orders of magnitude gain in the detector without the generation of additional detector noise. This would appear to create the same effect as receiving (or having transmitted) a corresponding larger signal, and thus providing for a correspondingly larger signal to noise ratio, or better receiver sensitivity. Therefore, the overall goal of this effort will be to identify and build upon one or more of the most promising existing or emerging LWIR detector technologies to provide a near term (1 to 3 years) LWIR detector solution which has optimum sensitivity (D*), bandwidth of at least 1 GHz, and operates at the highest possible temperature.

The JRFL is a staff-oriented planning process not easily adaptable to dynamic combat operations and cumbersome to adjust.

New architectures and technologies are needed to respond to issues arising due to continued shrinking of semiconductor fabrication process geometries. Existing approaches have not satisfied end-user needs, such as multi-channel I/O, low-latency, large image sizes, and high frame rates. Novel architectures are needed, and alternatives promising improved power efficiencies of the processor clock tree, logic, memory, and chip I/O must be investigated. Familiarity with the important algorithms, such as distortion correction, multi-spectral/multi-modal fusion, and head-tracking, is required to ensure the solution can meet the challenging performance requirements. Consideration must also be given to the robustness of the processor, as a warfighter\u0092s life may depend on its reliability in a challenging electromagnetic radiating environment. Finally, consideration must be given to a solution that can not only be applied to the digital binocular helmet-mounted display, but also to a wider set of applications that can take advantage of high-performance, low-power, low-latency image processing.  The processor requirements for the vision processor ASIC developed under the DARPA Multispectral Adaptive Networked Tactical Imaging System (MANTIS) program (2003-2010) is a good example. It was originally conceived to fuse inputs from five helmet-mounted electro-optical sensors operating in the visible-near infrared (VNIR x 2), short wave infrared (SWIR x 2), and long wave infrared (LWIR) bands and generate two synchronized SXGA video outputs at 60 Hz to a pair of microdisplays. However, it resulted in a processor that ingested three sensors (one each VNIR, SWIR, LWIR) and generated just one video output at 30 Hz due to the technical approach (e.g., architecture, microelectronic technologies) and processor geometry (90 nm) used at the time [1].  Under this program, a vision processor for helmet systems (VPHS) is required to enable the design and fabrication of a digital binocular helmet-mounted display (HMD) having all source image fusion with two video outputs. Binocular systems needed by warfighters require threshold (objective) performance comprising two synchronized video outputs, each at 60 Hz x 1.3 Mpx/frame x 8b/px = 0.624 Gbps (5Mpx x 8b x 96Hz = 3.84 Gbps), and must be capable of ingesting matching resolution video (in Mbps) from multiple sources (on-helmet or on-aircraft) comprising various mixtures of live video from sensors, synthetic imagery, and overlay symbology.  Monocular systems with similar processing requirements are also of interest.

Second, they are constantly trying to learn new tools that are being offered to them, each independent from one another with unique features, rules, syntax, interfaces, interaction techniques, etc.  The Air Force Cyber Vision 2025 (Maybury, 2012) enumerates four \u0093Focused, Enabling S&T Areas,\u0094 one of which is \u0093Optimize Human-Machine Systems,\u0094 and the near-term goal is summarized as providing \u0093Advanced Situational Awareness for Cyber Operators.\u0094  Similarly, Air Force Space Command's Cyber Superiority S&T Guidance states that \u0093for effective knowledge operations, technologies are needed to vastly improve man-machine interfaces to speed the assimilation of data and the development of actionable information and courses of action for cyber operators.\u0094  Based on these stated needs, the goal of this topic is to find innovative ways to optimize the assimilation, transformation, and visual presentation of cyber data in ways that support the operators\u0092 cognitive capabilities so they can effectively do their job.\r\n\r\nThe cyber domain has the unique characteristic that the resources necessary for superiority in the domain are not aircraft and airfields as in the air domain, but highly trained and competent personnel (Bryant, 2013).  This statement boldly places the success or failure of cyber superiority on the human factor - in the hands of the cyber operator.  Therefore, it is imperative that the information displays with which these operators interact are designed for effective human use.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this process must begin with a thorough understanding of the cyber analysts\u0092 job (goals, tasks, objectives, information needed, decision processes, etc.), so the design team can determine the cognitive processes that need to be supported when these operators are performing their tasks.  The design team will use this knowledge to transform data and design visualizations accordingly.  Some visualization techniques that may be considered are parallel coordinates, tree maps, recurrence plots, theme rivers, and/or any new or innovatively used existing graphical techniques.  Visualizations can be static or interactive to provide multiple levels of information - overview, zoom/filter, details on demand (Shneiderman, 1996).  Visualizations may also include innovative ways to apply visualization techniques from other domains to the cyber data problem (i.e., determining how to apply text visualization techniques such as tag clouds to network data).  Iterative prototyping and user feedback should be part of the design process to ensure the visualizations meet the user\u0092s needs.  A multi-disciplinary team will be necessary to perform the tasks in this effort.", "objective": "Determine innovative ways to transform cyber data into visual representations based on the cognitive needs of cyber operators; design and evaluate visual representations to determine operator effectiveness in performing cyber tasks.", "topic_number": "AF151-015", "proposals_end_date": "2015-02-18T05:00:00Z", "pre_release_date": "2014-12-12T05:00:00Z"}, "pk": 182}, {"model": "sbirez.topic", "fields": {"program": "STTR", "proposals_begin_date": "2015-01-15T05:00:00Z", "agency": "AirForce", "solicitation_id": "DoD STTR 2015.1", "title": "Measurement of Molecular Energy Distributions and Species Concentrations at MHz Rates in Turbulent Combusting and Nonequilibrium Flows", "saved_by": [], "url": "http://www.dodsbir.net/sitis/display_topic.asp?Bookmark=46488", "description": "Spatially and temporally resolved measurements of molecular energy distributions and major species concentrations in combustion and turbulent non-equilibrium flows are necessary to ensure accurate modeling of flow physics and chemistry. To investigate the structure of reaction fields in combustion or measure the molecular distribution of energy in test-vehicle boundary layers, point/planar measurements at MHz rates are required. MHz-rate in situ measurements of vibrational and rotational energy distributions along with mole or mass fractions of major species (N2, O2, H2) will allow unprecedented insight into energy transfer and reaction progress in non-equilibrium flows. Such measurements must be spatially resolved at a point, along a line, or in a plane with sufficient temporal resolution (sub-\u00b5s) to freeze the flow; furthermore, such measurements should not require flow seeding. \r\n\r\nMolecular energy distributions and major species could be tracked via various spectroscopic techniques such as spontaneous Raman, coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), Raman-excited laser-induced electronic fluorescence (RELIEF), and laser-induced fluorescence. Especially under some supersonic conditions (e.g., in detonation-based combustion devices), it is essential to measure vibrational and rotational temperature from the distribution of molecular energy states that are not necessarily in equilibrium and also measure concentrations of O2 and H2 to assess local fuel-air ratio. Similarly, improved measurements of molecular energy distributions in hypersonic boundary layers will enhance the fidelity of numerical simulations of the extreme pressures and temperatures in the Mach 8+ operational envelope of hypersonic systems. Current state-of-the-art technology is incapable of providing high-fidelity spatially resolved temperature and species measurements at a rate greater than 10 kHz. Though measurements at rates of 50 kHz or greater are possible through high-bandwidth atomic or molecular spectroscopy using tunable diode lasers, they are limited by inherent averaging along a line-of-sight and temporal averaging over the \u00b5s-duration tuning. Two-line planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) of a single species can provide temperature measurement based on relative population distributions in a 2D plane; however, the uncertainty in PLIF-based thermometry can be as high as 30 percent without detailed knowledge of the local chemistry. The objective of this effort is to develop high-repetition-rate, spatially and temporally resolved spectroscopic tools for measuring rotational and vibrational temperature and major species in turbulent or combusting nonequilibrium flows at MHz rates. The techniques developed should have a continuous, temporal interrogation length of at least 10 ms to encompass the run time of some detonation events and typical high-enthalpy shock facilities used for hypersonic experimentation.\r\n\r\nIn order to successfully perform the work described in this topic area, offerors may request to utilize unique facilities/equipment in the possession of the U.S. Government located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, during the Phase II effort.

DoD policy dictates that models, simulations, and associated data used to support DoD processes, products, and decisions shall undergo verification and validation (V&V) throughout their life cycles. For example, in the case of structural dynamic finite element models modal parameters and assurance criterion are often used as metrics for model updating and validation. Additional examples include models relevant to Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) or component inspection requirements. Unfortunately, experimentally determined properties are rarely presented with any quantified statistical confidence or uncertainty. This is primarily due to the extensive amount of data reduction that must be accomplished to estimate properties from measurements.

Compression methods should be developed in consideration of other factors such as transmission bandwidth [2], exploitation needs [3], and requirements. Compression can be achieved pre-processing or post-processing of sensor collection using various methods such as in hardware and software [4].  Various compression choices effect target classification, multiple-target tracking, and activity based intelligence.\r\n\r\nSensor phenomenologies (Synthetic Aperture Radar, Hyperspectral, LIght Detection and Ranging, Electro-optical/Infrared) impose specific, sometimes unique, considerations on sensor collection attributes and must be tailored to specific targets and mission parameters in order to optimize image quality such as the National Imagery Interpretability Rating Scale (NIIRS) needed for EEI satisfaction [5]. Settings to control compression in order to optimize bandwidth transmission and maximize data collection must be weighed against the data fidelity essential for exploitation and analysis. Additionally, considerations such as target location/orientation with respect to the geospatial positioning of the sensor and environmental conditions compound the mission planning and data/scene collection equations. Each of these considerations taken as a holistic set of variables has the potential of influencing the data fidelity required to answer specific operational imperatives. Operational needs can be achieved from single or multiple source sensor fusion techniques that are dependent on image quality.  Therefore the ability to precisely balance compression to accommodate mission expectations for bandwidth optimization with the data fidelity required for exploitation during the mission planning stage is critical and could be mitigated by a broker to optimize compression settings.
