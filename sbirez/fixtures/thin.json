            "description": "Since the launch of Sputnik I, the U.S. Air Force has been interested in monitoring Earth orbiting objects. With this interest, a worldwide network of (primarily) radar and optical sensors was piecewise developed, transitioned, and integrated into a system that is now known as the Space Surveillance Network and a global tasking center, the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC). The SSN has the mission of detecting, tracking, cataloging and identifying artificial objects orbiting the Earth, including active and inactive satellites, spent rocket bodies, or fragmentation. However, much of the architecture and operations behind this critical system are limited and outdated including: 1) 24-hour tasking cycle typically via email or stove-pipe mechanism, 2) ad-hoc reactionary tasking via phone, 3) minimal feedback to JSpOC on missed tasking or abnormal detections, 4) little to no information sharing between sensor sites, 5) tasking typically based on set return rate, not information gain expected, and 6) sensor sites do not return possibly beneficial information such as covariance, observation time, observation quality, or sensor specific feature data, such as radar cross-section and visual magnitude.\r\n\r\nThe SSN is in need of innovative techniques and approaches to leverage a future net-centric or grid-enabled infrastructure not bound by the current system limitations. This includes the ability to optimally task sensors such that the maximum information content is returned, Such capabilities would contribute to one or more of the following:\r\n1) Enable real-time information-based tasking and scheduling of distributed, heterogeneous sensors to include real-time feedback \r\n2) Enable the net-centric sharing and utilization of knowledge between sites within a sensor system\r\n3) Enable the prioritization and distributed de-confliction associated with routine and contingency tasking in support of SSA, Space Force Enhancement, and Space Control \r\n4) Enable the distinction between and integration of dedicated, collateral and contributing sensor sites and systems.\r\n\r\nAs appropriate, approximate Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) will include:\r\na) Time from central tasking to acknowledgment of receipt (Goal: 95 percent) \r\nc) Time from collect to data delivery (Goal:",
