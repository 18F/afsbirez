Files generated by `alembic`, the database migration toolkit.
There should be no need to manually manage files in this directory
or its subdirectories, *except that*, after every new migration
(generated by `python manage.py db migrate`), there will be a
new file in `versions` that should be `git add`ed to the repo.

There should also be no need to run `alembic` directly; the
appropriate commands are built in to `manage.py` as sub-commands
of `python manage.py db`.

Generic single-database configuration.
